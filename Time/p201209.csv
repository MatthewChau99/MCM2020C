She prefers the Gerbers, so we bunched them all into this pacifier tree to steam them up.<br />First off, when I received the box, I thought the tree was too small. We put about 6 pacifiers before it was stuffed.<br />Because it's small, they don't fit the Avent pacifiers too well since they don't have rings. Heck, they don't seem to hold any pacifiers if it doesn't have rings.<br /><br />The steamer seemed to work fine, but the tree was too hot out of the microwave. The drainer didn't seem to work well either, so I just had to tip over the bottom to spill the water out.<br /><br />It seems fine, but I wouldn't consider the tree a necessity.",2012-08-31

Same pacifier given to babies in the hospital!","My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth.  I frantically purchased several look-a-likes when we came home.  Even at the her tender age of just a few months old, she was not to be fooled by these silly knock-offs.  I had a diva on my hands and she wanted nothing less than the real thing.  I finally discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. Finally we were saved!<br /><br />During my search for the holy grail of pacifiers, I came across these wubanubs and bought them mostly because they were super cute.  And since I was starting a collection of pacifiers, I figured it wouldn't hurt to try.  Love, love, love these.  And my daughter does as well.<br /><br />First let me begin by saying that the pacifier, on these precious dolls, are practically identical to the make and material of the hospital variety and perfect for my little one.  They are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night.  My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth.  I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown.  I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier.<br /><br />Although, they are a little pricier than a traditional pacifier...you save money by not having to purchase another two pack because you don't know where the gazillion others you purchased went.  I have yet to lose even one of these.  They also make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It appears to be a somewhat  meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib.  So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills and actually pacify.<br />There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The [[ASIN:B0028H3ACS WubbaNub Tabby Kitten]] is my favorite.  I have noticed that this one along with the Tabby cat is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush; however, I have cut the pacifier out of just one after its seen some wear.  ( Just as a caution.)  Once you stitch the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with, unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket.  I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.<br /><br />Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free.",2012-08-30

The beads inside help to keep Wubba on our son's chest, even when he was very little, further reducing the amount of retrieval we had to do.  That adds up, and you can count it in whatever sanity is measured by.  The monkey is cute and soft, but very durable.  Whenever he gets grungy, he just goes in the wash with normal clothing.

It is ideal for breastfed babies. That is why it is one of the top pacifiers recommended by docs and hospitals.<br /><br />Even though my baby and I love this pacifier (it is the only one that we use) and I highliy recommend it, I do want think it is important to highlight some of the shortcomings/warnings that people should know about. But even with these problems, it is still the best option out there.<br /><br />Things you should know (but the pacifier is still worth it):<br />1) hard to hold: the little tiny tab on the back is really hard for a parent to find and hold. I have dropped this pacifier many times when trying to hold the little tab.<br />2) it is hard to clip: It is hard to find something to clip and keep this pacifier tied to baby. But that is the point. It is not recommended to stap the pacifier to baby because it is yet another item they can choke themselves with.<br />3) hard for baby to hold control: until baby is a bit older (3-6 months) and has better control of his/her hand, this pacifier is not easy for baby to hold and/or push back into the mouth. Other pacifiers have large handles or areas for small and uncontrolled hands to reach for and grab. Not this one.<br />4) CAUTION ABOUT SIZES: this is really important, and I only discovered this recently. There are two sizes (newborn 0-3 months) and (3+months). THe first size is much softer, the second size harder. It is important to change your baby to the larger size when they reach 3+ months because they start being able to bend the whole pacifier in the mouth and can even accidentally make the whole thing bend and fit in mouth! Super scary and dangerous. Though there are two small holes on either side of the pacifier that should allow baby to keep breathing if this were to happen, that gives me little comfort. The 3+ month size is much firmer and will prevent baby for bending and shoving the whole thing in mouth. So make sure you move to the second size!<br />* (theyhave also changed the way they package and label the sizes, to make everything more confusing! Before it was a newborn 0-3 month size, and then a 3/6month -18month size. Now the second size is simply labeled as 3+ months. Still the same pacifier, just new packaging to make sleep-deprived moms feel even more crazy....)",2012-08-23

The item itself seems terribly flimsy, and just has a cheap feel, much cheaper than I would expect from a product that's more expensive than a lot of competing products. Maybe it's composed of a tough, lightweight plastic, but if something looks cheap and feels cheap, well, let's just say it doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in a product.<br /><br />The next concern is battery life, which is rather poor. I guess those UV rays must take a lot of juice, because a fresh set of batteries doesn't last very long. That leads in to wondering just how well this thing works, especially when the batteries start to die down a bit. It takes about 3 minutes to sterilize a pacifier, but there's no real way to know how well it's working. Also, the directions tell you to rinse off the pacifier prior to use, so that might limit just how useful it is when you're on-the-go. Ultimately, I just wonder if using this is really any better than rinsing off the pacifier under very hot tap water.<br /><br />I wanted to like the Pipila Portable Pacifier Sterilizer, but at the end of the day, it just leaves me wondering if it's doing the job. I can see it having a place for people going out-of-town for a bit and wanting something available to help sterilize a pacifier if they're staying away from home, but the need for water (to rinse the pacifier) and the size (small, but not that small) limits its usefulness for those truly on-the-go, while there are better, cheaper ways to get the job done when you're at home.",2012-08-21

With our first child we used traditional pacifiers and we were constantly having to put it back in our child's mouth when it would fall out. But not the Wubba! This toy/pacifier is ingenious! It cuts down the need to replace it in the child's mouth drastically. If baby is sleeping with their head tilted to the side you can gently position Wubba so it is a prop up to hold the pacifier in baby's mouth. When baby is on their back looking up at the ceiling you place wubba on their chest and even if their little mouth relaxes and falls open during sleep, Wubba holds the pacifier gentaly in place so when baby seeks it -it is there! Before you know it little one will be holding on to it (great for helping to develop dexterity) and its too cute! We used to joke about how we wished there was a type of pacifier headgear... Well this is the closest thing to that without the odvious no-no's a headgear would bring ;-)",2012-08-04

They can handle multiple washings with little shrinkage.<br /><br />I don't know about you but receiving blankets take some abuse here.

The manufacturers might do well to either make the light brighter or make the thing hum or vibrate so it looks like it is doing something, but no - a normal light comes on and then it goes off and miraculously the pacifier that just fell on the floor is supposed to be sterile? I don't know.<br /><br />I do know that if it has snot on it or small pieces of dust or dirt, they don't fall off.

I must also say that its kind of bulky so if you have a very small baby bag this might not be what you want to take with you. Instead get some of those baby pacifier wipes. I have a [[ASIN:B001DKHPD6 Ju Ju Be Be All Diaper Bag, Lotus Lullaby]] and it took up quite a bit of space.<br /><br />I'm also really getting very skeptical about those 5 star vine reviews. Did any of them really use the product for more than one day? I'd go with the AMAZON VERIFIED PURCHASED reviews. None of them gave it 5 and barely any 4. Goes to show you exactly what kind of product this really is.",2012-05-23

She could successfully put this in her mouth from her chest at just over 2 months. No other binkie will do, she has no interest in them, we have 3 and she loves them all. Easy for mom to find in a jam too!",2012-04-29

My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth. I came across these and bought them because they were super cute but was unsure if my daughter would like them. Previously I had bought pacifiers that looked like the ones the hospital provided but were not. The plastic used to make them were shiny and for whatever reason my daughter had no interest in them. I later discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. These wubbanubs were in fact made of the same material and perfect for my little one. I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown. I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier. These pacifiers are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night. My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth. I have yet to lose these unlike the gazillion other pacifiers I have purchased over the years. They make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It is a somewhat meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib. So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills. There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The tabby kitten is my favorite.  I have noticed that it is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush, however, I usually cut the pacifier out after its seen some wear. Just as a caution. Once you stitch the the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket. I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.<br /><br />Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free.",2012-04-28

He became attached to it very quickly and wouldn't take any other pacifier when we were suppose to transition him off of it. But I thought no big deal what could it hurt. Well he is now 5months old and he did what they he could do. I had read of babies being able to stick the whole thing in their mouth n I too was a little skeptic about it but today he accomplished it! N thank goodness I was holding him when he did it because I had been putting him to bed with it and it could of been a lot worse. So yes some moms say that they have older babies taking it with no problems which might be the case BUT don't take the risk! Because when your baby starts teething like mine they want everything in their mouth and they get aggressive with it and believe it or not but they can fit it in their mouth!

However, I do not feel that it helps our little guy keep the pacifier in his mouth at all.  He's only 2 months old and was a preemie, so he has difficulty holding onto a paci regardless.  The soothie and gumdrop pacifiers are the only ones recommended by lactation professionals for nursing babies, so I feel like if you have to use one of the soothies, why not have a cute one?  To wash the dragon, I've just used a damp cloth with some dish detergent and let him air dry.  It has worn just fine cleaning him with this method.  Just a reminder, the soothie is stitched to the dragon, so you cannot change out the pacifier, unless you feel comfortable sewing and are crafty.  I feel like for the money the dragon costs, I'd be too afraid to botch the job! Overall, I think it's an adorable novelty, but not incredibly useful.  We just appreciate it for being cute and the baby looks sweet with the little dragon laying on his chest, it looks like they're kissing.",2012-02-14

The Soothie will definitely help you avoid any nipple confusion that might occur from using an orthodontic or other odd shaped pacifier.

I gave him one as he was getting ready to head down for his next nap.  It took a little work to get him to hang onto it, as he's been used to more traditionally shaped pacifiers (he's 11 weeks old), but he caught on fairly fast, and the next time he went to nurse I noticed that he was taking a deeper latch already!  I had some supply problems early on, so anything that encourages good latching and better milk transfer is okay by me.    I've noticed some reviews criticizing this pacifier for being a potential choking hazard.  Let me say that there is a degree of personal responsibility here.  These are not the hard plastic pacifiers most people are used to... they are medical grade silicone, made for newborns.  The whole thing is softer, more flexible, and yes, that means that you have to watch your baby to make sure he can't fit the whole thing into his mouth, because babies try that.  On the wrapper it says not to leave your baby alone with a pacifier (any pacifier), and I imagine that it's for precisely this reason.  If your child can fit the whole Soothie into his/her mouth, it's too small and you need to buy a binky that is appropriately sized for your child.    As for the suckerfish look... I think it's hilariously cute.    Update 2/19/12 - Still loving the Soothie, still refusing any and all other binkies.  Longer review on my blog:    [...]",2012-02-06

I live in Singapore and it took a while for the package to reach me and in the interim managed to find a more traditional style pacifier from Pidgeon but  with an olive shaped teat.  It's possible I would think more highly of the soothie if I had not tried the Pigeon pacifier first.  My baby  will take the soothie but does not prefer it over the pigeon one.  The problem with the Soothie is that it falls out of his mouth really easy.  If he lets up sucking for a moment it falls out of his mouth.  If it happens to roll out of his cot (which seems to happen more frequently than a regular pacifier) it always lands teat side down (regular pacifiers are more likely to land teat side up).  Additionally there is no cover for the soothie and it is more difficult to teather to a stroller or car seat so it is not a great pacifier to travel with.  In short:  I will use the soothies as back-ups as baby will take them but will not be buying more as a regular pacifier with an olive shaped teat is better",2012-02-02

My baby though would gag whenever she got the nipple into her mouth.  Not really sure why... but she never had Soothies in the hospital or anything and prefers the Avent pacifiers with the wider, flatter nipple.  Also, like many others have noted, it would have been nice if it could be sterilized.  I held the monkey over a pot of boiling water, being careful not to get the nose of the monkey too wet while the pacifier boiled.  Not sure how well it worked, but better than nothing!  The monkey could've been a bit heavier too, as it often fell off of my baby. (She's 4 months, so this would work way better for a kid still being swaddled.)",2012-01-20

It took some effort but I WAS able to do it (see the pictures I uploaded in the product images).<br /><br />The directions I got with the bear state that it can be tossed in the washing machine - pacifier and all - but I have not done that. It's a personal preference, just not sure how safe it is to get laundry detergent on a pacifier, even if it's rinsed. So I wash the pacifier by hand with hot water and replace it when necessary.<br /><br />When I first bought this my baby (then 8 months) did not like this bear because it was a bit heavy and it kept pulling the pacifier out of her mouth. Within a few days, though, she really got used to it. Before buying this, I was going nuts in the dark trying to locate the pacifier in her crib, and the fact that she has designs on her crib sheets didn't help matters because it was easier to lose among them! I purchased this bear to solve my problem, and it solved my baby's problem, too - when she starts crying at night she locates the bear (easy enough to do, even half asleep), puts the pacifier in her mouth and falls back asleep in no time. This bear is a lifesaver!<br /><br />EDIT: Dec/2013 - I recently had to replace this for my almost 2-year-old as she broke the loop. The original one I bought came in a drawstring bag with the green pacifier pictured as well as a clear plastic flat pacifier that looked like a teether. Now I spent more money (originally bought for around $11, this time bought for $15) and the pacifier pictured and the teether pacifier no longer comes with it. They really cheaped out and raised the price. I'm disappointed. Still a great product but not as pictured! I'd give this 4-stars now.",2012-01-19

Furthermore, it was too small and he had a hard time sucking/keeping it in. AUGH how frustrating.  Someone said;OH noooo he needs to have his sucking needs met.

One we passed that magic milestone of four weeks, we opened our new Wubbanub and a fast appreciation was had--babies love to suckle!  It calms them and allows them to gather themselves in the middle of a meltdown.  It is great to carry them through to the next feeding when they get older if you are trying to sleep train.  My son falls asleep within minutes when I put him down in his crib, awake with the Wubbanub--he always spits it out after he is asleep, but no need to restuff his mouth.  The little monkey legs and arms lay on the chest and help the pacifier stay put.  He also loves to grab it with his hands and arms in a big hug.  Our other pacifiers have laid useless in the diaper bag ever since we started using this one--would not have bought any other if I had know the power of the Wubba!",2012-01-06
