It was not around any water! My hair was dry and was using it to help make it straighter. At first it had a smokey smell and I thought maybe this is like a new hair dryer smell. My straightener sometimes smells like this if I use with my hair wet so I thought this was fine. I turned it out waited 5 mins then tried again and luckily I cautiously turned the hair dryer away from hair to make sure it was safe and sure enough fire came out I turned it off unplugged it and it patted it down with a blanket till I stopped.

I needed to purchase a new one quickly, saw this one in a local store, and picked it up.<br /><br />This dryer has several very nice features.  First, it has three HEAT settings (hot, warm, cool) PLUS two STRENGTH settings (low and high).  In addition, you have the option of boost the air flow with the turbo button and also using the cool shot button to set your style.  I have found that what works best for me is to mostly dry my hair on the high heat-high power setting, then go down to the low power for a minute or two of styling.  Using this method, I am able to complete my overall drying time significantly more quickly than with my old hair dryer.  This dryer's nozzle is a bit longer than that of my old dryer, meaning that I bumped my head the first few times I used it, but I quickly got used to this.  For a larger dryer, I find it to be relatively lightweight and relatively quiet as well.<br /><br />Another feature of this dryer is the removable back to allow you to clean the lint screen; although I was attracted to this concept, I am unable to get the back off!  Perhaps we just have a dud, but it simply does not move.  Also, I should mention that the attachment is HUGE.  I hadn't really planned on using it anyway, but when I did try to snap it on to the dryer, I could not get it on easily.<br /><br />Overall, I have have been quite happy with this hair dryer--I just wish the back would come off.  My final rating is 4 1/2 stars.<br /><br />Edited 4/1/13:  Good news--I was able to get the back off this morning!  It seems like it just suddenly came unstuck when I tried it again (after many tries).

How one can last 3 years and the next only a year is beyond me.  I gave them a second chance....but no more.  One spark in the eye could ruin your vision for life.  Dangerous product to say the least.<br /><br />Purchased this in 2009 and since the sparks started flying out of the dryer this week I decided to leave a review.  It's worked flawless until today.  My wife was drying her hair and sparks started coming out the end.  This has happened before with other dryers thus the reason for my 4 star review.  I'm buying another one as it will match the holes on the wall that are already there and it's been a nice small hair dryer....and for the price, can't beat it lasting 3 years.

A better design would include a case that fits better to it's base and doesn't leak light, and would also only have the light on when it's dark instead of all the time. Again, it's not quiet.

That had been the best hair dryer I had owned, and the American market doesn't have any (nothing of the same quality at least) as the one I'd had. So after a good nearly 10 years, the Tescom retired itself and I needed a replacement. I did a search for the same brand and several Panasonics came up. Panasonic in Japan makes great quality products so after a little searching and looking through reviews I ordered this model - mainly because of the adjustable styling brush AND it was dual voltage (I'd hate to have to get a voltage converter for something that is everyday use). This hair dryer is way better than the one I'd had for so long and I love it! Great for styling my bangs and giving my layers a little bit of body and slight curl at the ends.

Styles my hair nicely with no frizz. I've used it for more than 3 years and it still works perfectly.

It was way too noisy, overheated so much that it stopped working all together!! Well, at that time my hair was about half dried and straightened, with the other half wet and beginning to curl... So I had no option but to somehow get this thing working again! I reset it, gave it a few minutes to cool down and tried again on the low heat setting... It was ok and I completed drying my hair..<br /><br />The next time I used it, alternating between high and low heat, it seemed to be fine... The time after that, it overheated again and I finally gave up on it... Its no use investing even $20 in this piece...

When it arrived, it was not as large as I thought it would be...that's a good thing when you're tight on storage space. I would say this is a mid-size hairdryer. Not the full gigantic salon-sized version nor the mini travel version. It doesn't seem too noisy when on and the volume of air it blows is pretty decent.<br /><br />The overall construction is as you would expect for the price...a glossy smooth plastic outer shell surrounding the internal heating/electrical/mechanical workings. The switch is easy to manipulate into the desired setting: down for low and up for high. The cool shot button allows the hairdryer to ramp up into the high mode but blow out cool air. The filter cover on the end of the hairdryer is easy to remove by twisting off. I prefer this type of filter cover over the hinged version that you cannot run under the sink for a good cleaning. If you ever rinse the filter cover, make sure it is absolutely dry before putting it back on the hairdryer as water and electricity do not mix! On the topic of electricity, the hairdryer also features a GFCI plug in case your bathroom doesn't have a GFCI outlet. This feature trips the power off to your hairdryer in case it comes into contact with water, preventing electrocution.<br /><br />The weight is decent and lightweight, not too heavy to hold while drying your hair. The handle could be a bit more comfortable, but for the money I cannot complain that much.<br /><br />I don't know about durability, but I think it was a decent purchase and very utilitarian.",2013-01-26

It is pretty quiet too. I wish the detachable nozzle went on easier & was a little longer. My only complaint is regarding the length of the nozzle. They call it the &#34;concentrator&#34; attachment. When I am styling my bangs or blowing out my hair with a round brush - it makes the dryer too close to my head / hair and it makes styling more difficult.  My last hair dryer's attachment was longer with an air flow vent - to keep the air from blasting you in the head. I guess this will take some getting used to. Other than that - seems to be good quality. The plus is that it does dry my hair faster and with less noise.",2013-01-23

From reading the specs and reviews on this Andis 82005 dryer, I felt this one fit the bill. But after using it for a week, I have mixed feelings. Here is why:<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. Sleek looking (so what? Nice, but doesn't make your hair look any nicer)<br />2. Nice variety of attachments that stay attached nicely!<br />3. Long 10 ft. cord (if you need that, however I don't, and it really only gets in the way)<br />4. Hang loop<br />5. Dries hair fairly quickly (with Ion technology)<br />6. Outside stays cool to touch<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Heavier than the last two dryers we've had (Hot Tools Tourmaline Lite 1043 --- see my review on that one, and CHI low-EMF dryer).<br />2. Dries hair no faster than the two abovementioned ionic dryers<br />3. NOT quiet (in fact, louder than the two abovementioned dryers!)<br />4. Not enough speed/heat settings. Not much difference in heat settings, although speed settings are adequate.<br />5. Comb attachment actually hurts your scalp! Feels very scratchy, due to squared ends of the teeth.<br />6. Shiny silver-colored exterior shows prints, etc. much more than others.<br /><br />All in all, not a bad dryer... I guess I expected more. But I would probably go with another one next time.",2013-01-15

After trying unsuccessfully to get her to unplug it and put it away, I realized her life would be a whole lot easier if I just got her a wall mount hair dryer and deliberately mount it next to where she stands in front of the sink rather than mount it right next to the sink itself.  That solves a lot of problems: she doesn't have to use up drawer space for the dryer, I don't have to worry about her putting it away hot, it is always plugged in and ready, the coil cord never drags over the sink (so nothing getting knocked off the sink), and of course the risk of the dryer falling into the sink is practically eliminated.<br /><br />This hair dryer is conveniently small so it's easy to handle, even for a young teen with long hair.  It dries hair quickly because it is powerful despite its size.<br /><br />Wall mounting was trivially simple -- it took less than five minutes with my hand dandy drill/driver, bits, level, and a hand screwdriver (it is much better to use a manual screwdriver instead of a drill/driver to screw into wall anchors).

Update: after using this hair drier for 2 years, one day the handle got super hot and red and burnt smell started coming out of it. I disposed it right away. Not safe! Be careful.",2013-01-05

It seems very sturdy and yes, it has dried my hair in half the time of my previous ionic dryer.<br /><br />Note that the ionic setting emits less heat so if you need to style your hair you'll need to switch to the other position for more heat.<br /><br />I have round, straight hair, fine but thick and this dryer takes less than 5 minutes to fully dry vs. my other hair dryer I would dry for 5 minutes and walk out the door with wet hair.<br /><br />Also, worth noting that since my last haircut I hadn't been able to get it to look as good as when I walked out of the salon until I used this hair dryer! So now I'm convinced it's all about the hairdryer, forget everything else. Totally worth your money.<br /><br />If I hadn't already purchased this hairdryer I might have gone for the Solano since my hairdresser recommended that one (he also reminded me that the department store/box store dryers are not the same quality ionic dryers and you need at least 1875 watts...) but this one is nearly half the weight of the Solano and pretty darn great.",2012-12-30

I mean huge.  Now maybe it's because this baby is an 1875 watt job and all our other current and prior hair dryers are 1600 or less.  When it is open, it is bigger than any other hair dryer we have ever owned.  When it is closed (folded, for &#34;travel&#34; -- heh, like this would handily fit in a suitcase) this thing is almost as big as my dopp (shaving bag).  Fortunately we travel more by ground so we don't worry much about suitcase space.<br /><br />And, as others have mentioned, the cord does not reel in all the way without help or retries.  We can live with that.  Even once the cord is stored, the cordstop leaves about a foot of cord out.  It wasn't a surprise because other reviewers have mentioned this too.<br /><br />On the plus side it does dry hair quickly.  FYI, all the girls in our family have long thick hair.<br /><br />A very important feature this dryer has -- and a major reason I chose it -- is that it does have a &#34;medium&#34; heat setting.  (Most just have high and low, with low being very low.)  The reason &#34;medium&#34; is important, especially on a high wattage unit, is that &#34;high&#34; can blow circuit breakers.  If you don't whether you have 20amp service on an outlet, you may really want the medium setting.  (Ever try to get a hotel to reset your breaker while your wife's hair is wet?)  The &#34;medium&#34; setting dries hair just fine.  The high setting dries hair scary fast, but I'm not sure how good that much heat is for your hair in the long run, but it is nice to have when you're in a hurry.<br /><br />A word of advice about any high wattage appliance with a cord reel:  always pull the cord all the way out regardless of how much you need.  I don't know if it tells you that in the manual but it's always a good idea because a coiled cord carrying a lot of current will get hot.  From staring at this unit, it is possible the hair dryer draws the cold intake air across the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but I wouldn't rely on that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but I wouldn't rely on that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.",2012-12-22

And then it broke.  :(","I bought this hair dryer from Target 4 months ago because it had the best reviews of all the ones they had there on the shelf.  In my house, we only use the hair dryer around 3 times a week total between my husband and myself (I only have to style my hair once every 4 days or so)... so this thing got minimal use.  When I bought it I was annoyed at how the temperature switch (to go from hot to cold) is in a spot on the handle where you usually grip the thing while you're drying.  I would constantly accidentally switch it to the cold setting.  And, I never felt like this got hot enough to style my thick, unruly hair.  My hair is crazy thick and I need a lot of heat to get the frizz out while I'm drying and styling... but I've had to deal with this and hair dryers not being hot enough my whole life, so this wasn't a huge surprise.  But then, a few days ago the heat function just completely broke.  So, now it only blows cool air no matter what.. which makes it basically useless to me.  I suppose that for $25 I got my use out of it for 4 months... but I hate that I'm having to send another plastic piece of trash to the landfill a lot sooner than expected.  :(",2012-11-29

When you turn it on, it sounds like those cheap kid toys with a wind motor. Then it warms up a bit and you get used to the cheap motor and you dry your hair. It doesn't have enough air force!

The filter is there to keep your hair from being sucked into the back of the hairdryer, so for the rest of its life I had to be insanely careful of how I held it. Unfortunately, even my drastic efforts didn't save it--it only lasted about six months.

That is not a long time to evaluate it thoroughly, but it has been excellent so far.  Due to the retractable cord feature the barrel is a little fatter than other hair dryers that I have tried, but so far it is better than any other dryer I have used!  I think that if you use reasonable care when retracting the cord (like running the cord through your fingers as it retracts, to slow it down and straighten out any twists), it should last a long time.  I think that letting the cord zoom up at full speed, like I have inadvertently done twice, might shorten the Cord Retraction devices life (as some reviewers have reported).  I do not think that will be a problem though, if you use reasonable care and let the cord retract through your fingers.

Great for at home or on the road.","I recently was medically retired from the military. As part of my transition to the civilian world, I have decided to grow out my hair because, in my mind, I believe I will one day look as stylish and sexy as Leonardo Decaprio. I am finding, though, that to achieve that look there is a lot involved including blow drying your hair. Not just for style but functionality as walking around all morning with wet hair is not fun.<br /><br />This ceramic hair dryer is amazing. It folds up saving space which is great since I am an organized O.C.D. son of a gun after so many years in the military. To add to the storage technique the cord conveniently retracts back into the main body of the blow dryer.<br /><br />This means that I can use the hair dryer both at the home and on the road as I do travel quite  a bit and find the hair dryers that come free in many hotel rooms leaving a lot to be desired.<br /><br />For its size, this hair dryer is also very powerful. I was surprised at both the amount of air it is able to blow as well as how hot it is capable of getting. It comes with a cool blast button which circulates regular room air. I use this setting when blowing hair off my neck after shaving it or after cutting my children's hair.<br /><br />Probably one of the biggest selling points, since I am a man, is the stylish grey/silver/black colors that feel manly in my hand versus the lime green and hot pink blow dryer my wife tried to get me to use the other morning.<br /><br />Overall, a very attractive and functional hair dryer that also has durability on its side.

This one has a powerful heating element (1875 watts), and a good fan (for its size). The purpose of a hair dryer is not to heat up the hair to boil away the water, but to speed up the evaporation process of drying by exposing the hair to a stream of hot air. The faster the stream and the warmer the air, the more evaporation occurs.  Where this dryer differs is in the body that has a longer and narrower nozzle that is about one inch wide. This forces a much stronger blast of air (at least on high speed) that is not a wide as those dryers with a wide nozzle.<br /><br />If your hair is fine, colored, permed or naturally curly, you would want a different dryer with a wider nozzle to diffuse the heat so that the hair dries more slowly at a cooler temperature. That may make the hair less likely to frizz and it may give the hair more volume.<br /><br />This dryer makes the nozzle narrow and thus helps to concentrate the heat into one spot in order to make the hair it blows on dry rapidly. You can adjust the fan speed and the temperature, but not the concentration of the air flow.<br /><br />So, if you have regular hair or (like me) are a guy that just wants to dry their hair rapidly, this is the dryer for you. Put it on high speed and high heat and it is extremely fast.",2012-10-23

I was concerned since several reviews stated that they had problems with the unit failing after using it only for a short time.  So far I am very pleased with my purchase and am considering buying two more to keep as reserves.  It is almost impossible to buy 1600 W dryers now and even harder to find dryers than have the side mounted motors and fans which I like.  The new 1875 W dryers can cause circuit breakers to trip and I don't feel we need that much heat on our hair. We must all remember that in this economy everyone is trying to cut costs, and that pertains to hairdryers as well as everything else.  Anything we can do to reduce the shock to a new appliance can possibly lengthen the life of the product.

Sure I will get used to it, but is something that should be fixed in future models.",2012-09-01

The other two have barely any room between the bristles, and so unless you have extremely short hair, you are not going to be able to run it through your hair. So you are left with the Boars hair brush. But that too, is pretty much useless, because the bristles are really long, and really weak, they don't get into your hair at all, rather they just skim over the top of it.

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!  SENT THE WRONG PART AND WON'T SEND A REPLACEMENT!!!","I am a hair stylist and I am about to open my own salon.  There is a lot of stress involved in opening your own business but receiving the CORRECT product should not be one of them.  I did my research and ordered through Amazon because noone had ever let me down when ordering through them.  Until now.  I ordered a portable hair dryer and waited patiently for it to be delivered.  When I received it, I opened the box and began putting it together.  One of the pieces did not fit so I just thought that maybe I was doing it wrong.  After myself, my landlord, AND a maintenance man tried to put it together, we all agreed that the wrong part was delivered and that I should call customer service to ask for a replacement.  After one email and two phone messages, I received a phone call back only to tell me that the manager said that the piece does fit and to try harder.  WHAT??!!  I tried so hard that I gashed my finger!  The customer service agent was very nice but had to relay this message to me from the manager.  So my question is...How in the world do you know if THIS piece actually fits?!  Is it possible that I received a faulty part?????  So now my only two choices are to go back and try to fit this piece in and possible hurt myself worse (it's a metal pole by the way) or send it back.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS COMPANY.

I found it at walmart for $35, which wasn't the most expensive one that they had, but I've used John Frieda products before so I figured it would be a good try. So far, I really like this dryer. It feels like it could be a lot more expensive.<br />I compared it to my mother's $80 or so hairdryer and it actually keeps up with it pretty well. I really like how the engine feels and sounds. It works pretty quiet and has a low hum rather than the high pitched noise a lot of cheap-o hairdryers have. It doesn't shoot the air quite as fast and it doesn't get QUITE as hot as the $80 blowdryer my mom has, but it's pretty great at it's job because my hair actually looks better when I use this hairdryer vs the more expensive one. It definitely fights frizz very well.<br />The only problem I'd say I have with it is that it's a heavier dryer than my old one that broke. I say problem because people may dislike that but I prefer it that way. When dryers have a bit of weight to them I feel like they've got a stronger motor. Not to mention I really don't notice when I'm using it.<br />As for the people complaining about the buttons, I can't say that I can relate. I guess I have very small hands so I can hold the dryer pretty well without messing with the buttons too badly, but so far EVERY blow dryer I've seen has the buttons on the side pannel like that, I think you just have to get used to it.<br />Overall, awesome dryer.

I've always wanted a simple solution to great hair and this is exactly it. I used to own a Conair from the drug store and this Sedu has changed my perspective on hair dryers. I've always thought that I can never re-produce the kind of blow out that I get from salons but this hair dryer has made it possible. The air is pretty strong and I don't find the hair dryer heat up more than my drug store one. It does take most of the frizz away and my hair stays in a nice curve for the whole day when I use a round brush.<br /><br />To be fair though, this hair dryer more expensive so you would expect the higher quality to match the price tag. Another thing I found is that it's actually kinda heavy for its size. My old one is bigger but actually weight about the same as this one, maybe even less.

It's the tiniest dryer I've ever seen!!!  It almost fits in the palm of my hand.  Folded, it's 4-5 inches long (not counting the cord).  I've been using it for about a week now just to test it out before my trip abroad and it's surprisingly very strong.  No weird smells as someone else mentioned- maybe their particular product has an issue.  So far mine is working great.  My hair is shorter so I'm not worried about how long it will take, but this thing is pretty strong.  I'm done in minutes.  The other great thing is that it has &#34;dual voltage.&#34;  I had to read up on this because I haven't traveled in a while and I guess a whole lot of electronics and stuff like this is made dual voltage today- so check your product and educate yourself.  Just look at this hair dryer, for example, and it will say 125V / 250V on the handle.  This means it will work anywhere where the voltage falls in that range... most if not all of the world. BUT YOU WILL NEED AN ADAPTER when going abroad with this.  So here is the tricky part if this stuff is new for you, too... you DON'T need a converter (more expensive) for anything that's dual voltage,  just an adapter.  The adapter is just the little plug part that goes into the wall so you can plug it in.  The converter is usually bigger and box-like and more expensive.  It converts the voltage. You can find adapters for just a few bucks.  Some dual voltage products have a little switch you have to bother with and it's dangerous if you forget to change that switch... no switch and no worries with this hair dryer!!  Just Google dual voltage and you can read up on it, and the difference between converter and adapter.  All these things are helpful to know when traveling abroad.  I love this thing... best thing I bought for travel recently since finding a hand-held luggage scale!  I originally jumped the gun and gave this5 stars.  Read my updates below.  12/20/12 Update:  This survived a trip to rural abroad and worked great, so long as I used it on low.  When I turned it on high it was like a crazy loud rocket ship and I thought it would take off or start fire- it was frightening!!!!  Yes, I did use my adapter, and it's possible it behaved this way because of the junkie old remote house with questionable wiring I was living in. Later I lived in a second, very modern house in the country's modern capital and it wouldn't plug into the wall at all in any part of the house!!  Yes, it was the right plug shape and I have no idea what that was about, again, the randomness is possibly the result of the house and the country I was in.  Who knows.  But I couldn't use it at all the last couple of months of my travels and that wasn't good.  I will continue to use it here at home in the USA where it works perfect.  Maybe better for local travel and still a great size if you have limited luggage space.  But I am changing my rating from 5 to 3 because the darn thing nearly gave me a heart attack the few times I accidentally put it on high while trying to turn it off.  I am still highly recommending this product for travel, but taking it abroad may be questionable.  1/15/13 UPDATE:  I barely started using it back home a month and the dang thing started making crazy noises and I thought it would explode or catch fire.  It basically went dead.  I tossed it in the garbage.  I am now changing my 3 star rating to 1 star.  I was wrong.  Turns out this was a piece of unreliable junk and potentially dangerous unreliable junk after all... didn't even last me a year.  And I barely used it!!!  Not fit for my traveling adventures.",2012-06-28

Knowing that over the years there had been many an upgrade to hand-held blow-dryers, I spent about half a day reading through all the reviews on Amazon and checking out Consumer Reports (the latter being not much help in this area, I have to say).  This little jewel seemed to fit my needs:  quiet, light, multiple temperature selections and speeds, and a cool setting, too.  Plus, it had that fancy-shmancy ion stuff that's supposed to make your hair shine (although my thought on that was, yeah, right).  I have to admit, too, that I am partial to Conair as I have found that they last for YEARS and provide a nice powerful flow of air that helps me style my usually short hair.  Well, this new Conair 173RZ Ion Shine Ceramic Turbo hair dryer is now my new love.  It blows through my hair like a strong wind and the temperatures range from hot to cool with a perfect warm in-between (my usual setting).  The slide temp/power selection system is not my preference, as my thumb sometimes slips and I end up with the wrong setting for a second, but I am getting used to it.  It gets my hair dry in less than a minute.  While the dryer is not what I would call a whisper, it is not as loud as my previous Conair and for that I am thankful.  A nice little extra is that it folds in half at the top of the handle - great if you have storage issues.  But, the most surprising thing of all is that my hair actually DOES shine when I'm done!  I have salt and pepper hair and the salt gleams like sparkling silver threads afterwards.  What a treat!

I was fed up having cheap blow dryers that never lasted. I loved the blow dryer, it lasted me till a month ago. Guess the $110 I paid for it back then was worth the 6 years I got out of it. I was looking at buying the same one or at least a Chi blow dryer again, I just didn't want to spend the same amount of money, I was hoping to stay under $60. I did a bunch of research and saw that this blow dryer, T3 Featherweight, was on the list of best blow dryers the last few years and saw the price was close to what I wanted to pay and $30 cheaper than the Chi I had before. I also saw that it said it was a fast drying blow dryer like my old Chi, which I prefer since I have a ton of hair. After using it for over a week. I think it works pretty good.. not much difference from my Chi I had. It's lighter than my chi and it's made of some kind of plastic like material. It also looks solid white and black in the picture, but it's actually got some kind of silver pattern going on over the white which I'm not thrilled with, but it's not the reason I bought the blow dryer so I'll get over it. Seems to take about the same amount of time to blow dry my hair as the chi, maybe a little faster. I usually take about 8-15 minutes to blow dry my hair depending on how detailed i get with it, like I said I have a ton of hair. (thick Mid-back length hair)<br /><br />Why I give this a 4 instead of a 5, I prefer my Chi a little more, maybe it's the solid feel of it.

I was a bit hesitant to get a fold-able travel dryer since their reviews don't tend to be as good, however this one was the exception, which is why I went for it. The main features I was looking for in a new dryer was the weight, size, power and I would prefer it to be a ceramic dryer since they are healthier on your hair. My old dryer was the Vidal Sassoon VS501 1875W Ionic Sensor Touch Dryer. The VS501 lasted me several years and technically it still works. I've dropped it enough times that the front cover has broken making it a bit difficult to work the buttons. Below I have compared the two dryers:<br /><br />Conair 173RZ VS.

I don't even KNOW a man who uses a hairdryer, so I don't know why this is for Men. That being said, this is the best hairdryer I have ever used. Don't ask me to explain what that Ionic setting does---the manufacturer doesn't even explain it to my satisfaction. But, somehow, it DOES WORK on my cobweb-fine, delicate, difficult, body-less, totally straight, almost-waist-length hair. I wear it long and braided so I can ignore it as much as possible, and so it doesn't fly around all the time and get tangled in stuff or end up in people's food.  I only wash it once a week because it's so darn dry---it would probably all fall out if I washed it every day. I don't perm, color, or otherwise mess with it because chemicals just destroy it. I've had the split ends of my braid knot up so badly in the wind that I've had to cut an inch or more off. Most hairdryers are really hard on my hair, so I use them as little as possible.<br /><br />I like the design of this hairdryer---it's fairly light, comfortable to hold, and the attachment nozzle is nice for focusing the air where I want it. There's nowhere my hair can fly into the works and get tangled. I use the ionic setting with the heat on high, and control the amount of hot air with the handy cool burst blue button that turns the heat off. My hair dries faster and untangles easier than it ever has in my life. Not only that, but it STAYS untangled all week. How is this possible? I don't know. I DON'T CARE!<br /><br />I thought maybe I was imagining all this, so I asked my daughter-in-law to try it. She said, That was the best experience I've ever had with any hairdryer in my whole life.<br /><br />Please don't comment that this can't possibly work and it's all unscientific and that I'm making stuff up, as someone has on one of my other reviews.

I don't know but I am really glad to have it.  Purchased at Folica when they had a $40 off special.<br /><br />I have thick medium length wavy fine hair.  Wash it 5-6 days a week at the gym.  Had been using their Hot Tools dryers-- two at a time, one in each hand--quite a spectacle -- and then using a flat iron.  I was happy with the end result but wanted to reduce the time spent.<br /><br />Researched the dryers to death and then just got fatigued and popped for the Sedu as it has tourmaline and ionic, and it has a regular plug-- I had some bad luck with those huge GF plugs on my hair iron.  The price is insane but since I use this nearly every day . . . .<br /><br />Compared to the Hot Tools dryer, this does not get hotter (which is a good thing because the Hot Tools is plenty hot enough to fry your hair), but it does blow more forcefully.  The dryer is small and easy to handle.  Did not find it at all heavy.  Was able to use the one dryer in one hand and brush in the other.  It still got my hair dryer faster than using the two Hot Tool dryers.  And much straighter and much smoother.  That was the surprise, and the reason I say I am a skeptic no longer.  Something about the dryer-- the tourmaline? the ions? really does make a difference.  Because my hair was already straighter by the time it was dry (since I could use the brush) the time spent using the flat iron was significantly reduced.<br />I hope that with in addition to reducing the time I have also reduced the trauma to my hair.<br /><br />I cannot tell if this is worth the big premium over the Solia and the SuperSolano which both look to be very nice dryers.

It worked great for about two months and then it started throwing out blue sparks again! I have used the dryer at my house & while on vacation out of state and it still sparks regardless of where I plug it in. I hate to bad mouth any product from Remington because I am a fan of their other products, but I just don't see how this can just be a coincidence. When I contact Remington, I can never get through directly to someone. It's not really worth trying to get them to send me a new one--I have learned my lesson once and for all.

After this review I decided to contact the Remington online customer service and sent them a message with my complaint.  Shortly thereafter I received an email from them asking me to return the broken one and they would send a replacement.  They sent the shipping box and the label as well and within 10 days I had a new dryer that I have been using since with no problems.  Granted it has only been a month but I was very impressed with Remington.  I just hope that no one there was injured when testing the dryer (lol)... it really did blow flames.  Obviously there was a short which could happen with any electrical product but it was the way that the company responded that I had to give the rating of 4 stars when previously I only give it 1.  I really do like this dryer and how my hair looks and feels afterwards which is very different from other dryers that are no ionic.  Plus it dries my hair super fast without drying it out.<br /><br />PREVIOUS REVIEW:  Bought this dryer 4 months ago even though I read the bad reviews as well as the good ones and was concerned but figured it was a good brand name. i only use a hair dryer at most 2x/wk. Last night I was using the dryer on my wet hair and flames and sparks started shooting out of it!!! Thank God my hair was wet and didn't have any flammable product in it. I showed it to my boyfriend who suggested that I contact consumer affairs for Remington, which I just did. Since it has been over 30 days I can no longer return the appliance to Amazon. I have had many hair dryers and most of the time they have just worn out after a year or 2 but this was just scary.<br /><br />1/18/13 - Almost 1 year later... and still working perfectly.  In fact, I bought another dryer in the interim, waiting for the new Remington and paid a pretty penny for the new one.  I used both multiple times, trading off one for the other. I found that I prefer the Remington over the other more expensive name brand dryer. The Remington does not leave my hair fly away and seems to give it a nice sheen (is that possible?). It drys my hair better and more evenly.mington over the other more expensive name brand dryer. The Remington does not leave my hair fly away and seems to give it a nice sheen (is that possible?).

My husband thinks the dryer is ugly. He has never used a hairdryer on his hair because he wears his hair close to the scalp or completely bald.

I don't remember the brand, but it was really expensive and high end. I think it was somewhere around $175 new. So, the other day the heat finally went out on it and I needed to replace it. This time, no question, anything other than an ionic simply won't do. Anyways, I found this one and just used it for the first time with a completely wet head and I am so impressed, I can't even believe it!! I'm not sure if the ion charges on my old dryer had gradually worn out, or if the technology now is just that much better? But I couldn't be happier. It took all of 10 minutes to completely dry and style my hair and it looks amazing, with VERY little frizz and enhanced the shine too. My other blow dryer had been taking me more like 15 minutes. This Remington does have greater watts / power too, but even on the lower setting, my hair was getting dry faster and styling perfectly. I should also mention the design is really neat looking too. It does not feel as heavy (quality) as my other one and the precision (extra) part felt like it was made kind of cheap. But, of course! My other one was about four times more expensive.

Here's what we found:<br /><br />My husband has very short hair and only uses a hairdryer on occasion.  He thought the Mangroomer felt good and solid in his hands-light weight and dries his hair no different than any other hair dryer.<br /><br />My son used the Mangroomer for a few days.  He has longer hair (about 3 inches long), just over the ears.  He traded off between a smaller, cheaper hairdryer to the Mangroomer and thought it was less noisy than the cheaper, older model he is used too.  He thought the dryer was sleek looking, more manly than the girl hairdryer he has been using.  The different speeds and temperature settings were a plus considering he's never had the choice.<br /><br />Lastly myself, I have shoulder length hair that has a course texture.  I use a hairdryer every day.  The Mangroomer looks and feels manly.  In comparison to my 1 year old Remington hairdryer, the main handle is wider and less fitted to the hand.  The buttons do not get in the way in comparison to other hairdryers that place them front and center.  The buttons on the Mangroomer are on the side, which never seem to get in the way.  The Ion button is located on the side of the barrel with a cool blue button indicator.  With or without the Ionic button I felt the dryer was the same.  A huge plus to this hairdryer is the speed in which it dries your hair.  It pushes a lot of air to dry quickly.  Another important thing to note is in comparison to my hairdryer the air does not get as hot, personally I think this is why the hair feels softer and more manageable than when I use the other hairdryer.  I actually noticed a difference in the softness of my hair.  It seems absurd to think a hairdryer can do this but as a person who dries her hair daily, I won't be going back to the other hairdryer, even if this one is built bigger for a man.",2012-02-25

I purchased two sets of two hair dryers for my daughters for Christmas.  Each set had a travel size and a full size hair dryer.  They were $200.+  for each set.  At the time I made this purchase, reviews were pretty good and the warranty for each  hair dryer was for 4 years.  Within 6 months, both travel size dryers were no longer working.  They smelled of burning wires, and were VERY HOT!  The company REFUSED to replace them, saying they no longer made this particular model.  Before the end of the 1st year, one of the regular size dryers had gone bad as well(same hot, burning smell), and the other before 15 months was up.  Comapny wouldn't return a phone call or answer an email.  I tried many times for 3 months, finally giving up and calling the seller (QVC).  I really didn't expect them to do anything after 15 months, ( and they didn't), but I wanted to warn them about the company not standing behind the warranty that they used in their sales pitch.  They are still selling them, so this warning is for potential buyers from anywhere.  DON'T BUY T3 brand products!!!",2012-02-21

It feels soft to the touch rather than the slick plastic of the older models. But after just a couple of weeks of use, the coating started bubbling and peeling off in the area where I hold the hair dryer. I've only had it for a month and a half, and the outer coating looks positively pathetic already. I also don't like the settings on this model--there are only two speed settings, with the lower one being barely on. The high setting is okay, but it does make me feel like I'm in a wind tunnel at times.  This hair dryer has some pros: It gets quite hot, and it's fairly lightweight.

I guess they felt this was an under-served market even though the total available market (tam) for men is probably much smaller than the women's market when considering that a) there are alot more bald men than women, b) alot of men barely comb there hair so they certainly don't blowdry it, and c) the wife's hairdryer is already sitting there if needed.  But, if you want a manly hairdryer then I guess this fits the bill.  It does have manly color - evokes feelings of a red Corvette.  It is substantial weight and feels good in the hands.  It appears to have extra horsepower to blow hair in a manly fashion and it has lots of speeds to fiddle with.

I actually bought this at Target because my other dryer had stopped working and I couldn't wait a few days for a new one to be shipped to me. I went with the intention on getting a different one but I got to hold them both in my hand and I really liked the way this one felt. The handle is sort of slanted back, which sounds awkward but it feels more balanced this way. It also doesn't have that annoying high pitched whining sound that accompanies most dryers. I also like that there is a cold shot switch that you don't have to hold in. It stays on cold shot until you switch it off. The sliding power switch isn't difficult to slide. The tension is just right in that you're not going to accidentally switch it off constantly during use, nor will you have a hard time getting it to move.

When I first started using T3's pro ionic/ceramic hair dryer last year,I noticed and felt an immediate difference on my hair. After using it for about two months, I'm very happy with the results. My hair became more manageable and is less frizzy. It is soft and smooth. I thought all the Touramaline ionic/ceramic hair dryers would produce similar results. So I was searching for a less expensive alternative one so that I can have two ionic dryers on hand. I read the positive reviews on this Andis hair dryer, then I decided to purchase it. I'm thankful the delivery was super fast! After using it a few times, I have to say the result is just mediocre. Compare to T3, this Andis model loses its shine! My hair feels dry after using it. It doesn't seem to be able to smooth out my hair or create shine and eliminate frizz as well as the T3 does. It works just like a regular hair dryer for me, except because of the ionic in it, it does dry hair faster than non-ionic hair dryers. Overall, here are the pros & cons in my opinion on this Andis 75370 Tourmaline ionic/ceramic hair dryer.<br /><br />PROS: It has a beautiful black and gold finish on the exterior; a good size for home use; powerful air flow; dries hair fast; 3 heat settings/2 air speeds; has the cool shot button;<br /><br />CONS: feels heavy on hand & noisy; heat settings/air speeds settings are in odd position, the switches seem to get in the way while holding and using the dryer; the blue ion indicator light is extremely bright, it's very annoying; the overall result in terms of adding silkiness and shine isn't impressive; not sure if the heating material is made with solid ceramic?<br /><br />The Bottom line: This hair dryer is not bad, it does the drying job alright. I just don't think it's great for those with thick/wavy & coarse hair type hoping to get smoother and luster result after blow dry.

I'm so glad it arrived quickly or my hair would've been toast! I have thick, fine, fuzzy flyaway hair and with the pik attachment I have had no problems. The only problem was on my end. When the unit arrived, I thought the spongy tape material within the concentrators were for packing purposes so removed it. I had to get some more from a local craft store so DO NOT REMOVE THAT TAPE!! My bad.<br /><br />Again, I'm not a professional but I don't want charbroiled hair either. I'm pretty confident that won't happen with either of these products and the other haircare products I use.

I dont use perfume every day, but I keep this little rollerball in my purse cosmetic bag in case I go to an afterwork event or to freshen up if I'm on the go all day before meeting someone out. I'm no scent expert, but to me Fiori d'Arancio smells like *delicate fruit loops* Ok that sounds totally wacky but its a sweet, clean fruity smell, and smells natural--you can tell there arent chemicals in the scent unlike gross body splashes and stuff. its really hard to find a way to smell these before purchasing too, (occasionally you can find sample vials on an auction or deal site) and they are expensive, so the mini is a great way to test it out in an affordable way before upgrading to a full size. If the fruit loop smell is not for you, pass it on to a teenage girl you love. Personally I love it! Sometimes I mix it with my lavanilla rollerball for a delicious fruity vanilla scent!

I used the longest settings for the top (maybe 1.5), shorter settings for the side, and the shortest settings around the ears and back for a tight taper.

Finally, on Christmas, it was mine!  I love this dryer so much.  It dries my hair SO much faster than any other dryer - even some pricier ones I've used in the past.  The best part is that it doesn't leave me a sweaty mess when I'm done.  I don't know if it's just the air speed, or the well-designed air flow and concentrator, but even though it can blast some HOT air (I actually have to back it down to medium heat when I have the concentrator on), I am not dripping in sweat when I'm done blowing it straight section-by-section with my round brush.  This makes me so happy!  I can wash and dry my hair and be ready for makeup in so much less time than I've ever been able.  It's no louder than average.  It's no heavier than average.  But it works so much better than average.  I love how you press the cool shot button and it stays cool, then push it again and it goes back to hot.  No more holding it down awkwardly.  I have accidentally pressed it a time or two, but so easy to press it back and move my hand down a smidge.   My hair is very fine and a bit wavy, and I have a LOT of it, so I really need a dryer that can get in there and start drying out the hair, especially in the back and at the crown, before I start sleeking it down with the concentrator, and this dryer can do it in minutes without me sitting around air-drying it for 20-30 minutes first.

I haven't timed how long it takes to dry my past-shoulder length hair, but it is definitely under 5 minutes, and fast enough for me to do what I need to do.<br /><br />- leaves my hair in better condition - I always winced at using my old hairdryer because I knew I was damaging my hair in the process. I've had chronic dry hair issues and my old dryer left my hair flying every which way. I used to dry my hair only partially to lessen the damage. This dryer hasn't erased my dry hair issues completely but my hair is noticeably softer and I don't worry the way I used to about using it on my hair.<br /><br />- leaves my hair better looking - This was the biggest surprise of all. I have had such problems with my hair that I had simply resigned myself to the fact that my hair is hard-to-control. My hair is past shoulder length as mentioned, and layered. With my old dryer I absolutely needed to style my hair if I wanted to look presentable. I've spent so much money over the years trying out different brushes, rollers, etc. I could never simply wash, dry and go because with my old dryer my layers always ended up sticking out rather than curving in, and my hair would not hold any style without significant work. I was honestly shocked the first time I used the John Frieda dryer - my hair fell into a very flattering shape after 2-3 minutes of drying. I don't use a brush, don't use any of the attachments, nothing. I just dry about 90% of the way and my hair looks great. It's too bad that a month before I found this I'd already invested in a set of steam rollers. Now I won't be needing any of those tools.<br /><br />The noise level is normal for a hairdryer. I would not say it is quiet but it is not annoyingly loud. It is also quite manageable and easy to hold. I'm petite (small wrist) and I was afraid this would be a bit unwieldy, but it is lightweight enough to use without feeling at all flimpsy or cheap.<br /><br />The only fault I have found so far is the positioning of the buttons, right where my hand holds the dryer. For this reason I keep accidentally switching the air from hot to cold without wanting to. But it's a minor point given all the other advantages.eable and easy to hold.

I have long hair of medium thickness and people always think it must take me forever to blow dry my hair, but it only takes about 5-10 minutes with this dryer.

My hairdresser convinced me to get a new dryer so I picked her brain for what features to look for. When my daughter said she wanted a new dryer I pulled out the list of features my hairdresser gave me and that made me think to share it here.   1) concentrator  That's the main thing my old one lacked and why it was worth buying a new one - just for that. I have shorter hair and use a curved brush to style in shape; the concentrator focuses the heat on the curve I'm styling and it does make a big difference. The dryer also comes with a diffuser but that's for completely different hair than I have.  2) power - my stylist gave me a number of Watts and I don't remember the number but this unit exceeds it. This is something to be careful of anyway. We had an electrician looking at a problem with blowing the bathroom circuit and he said it's common for new hairdryers to blow the circuits on old houses because new ones are so much more powerful. That turned out NOT to be our circuit problem but thought I'd mention that there are practical limits to high power that are a pain to cross. This dryer puts out all the heat my scalp can take.  3) cleanable vent- the back grille should be easy to open & clean out lint. Major impact on strength of the fan & on life span of the appliance if you keep the lint out.  4) 3 heat settings  5) 3 fan settings (this unit is actually a compromise with only two fan speeds + off but I always use high anyway 'cause  I'm impatient)  6) swivel cord vs. retractable cord - My hairdresser said she looks for a swivel cord but it was pretty well impossible to find in less expensive models even in beauty supply stores (realize pros pay over $100 for professional hairdryers) I looked high and low for this feature. It probably extended my search for a new hairdryer by almost a full year. I finally gave up on it when I set my sights on a retractable cord. The retractable feature also seems to keepthe cord tangle free. My curling iron has a swivel cord but it gets more tangled because it gets all scrunched up in the drawer. My biggest concern was that the retractable cord would give out but it's still going strong after 1 1/2 years. I love this feature as it keeps my dryer neatly tucked away in its drawer.   7) cold shot - My hairdresser didn't include this feature because she doesn't use it  but I wouldn't buy a dryer without it. This is a button that, when pushed in, makes the dryer switch to unheated air which sets a curl/curve much, much better. it takes a little more time to style the hair (which is why hairdressers often don't use it) but my style lasts days longer. Easy feature to find but it's not universal so if you want it you need to check for it and this dryer does have it. It's the blue button on the top of the handle.  Bottom line: I love this dryer. If it's been a while since you bought a new one, go for it. You'll be amazed at what a time saver it is. At this price from Amazon, it's a great value. In my area Target & Walmart sell this dryer for $5 more plus tax.  I'd buy it again in a heart beat.",2012-01-01
