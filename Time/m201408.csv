I got rid of my previous huge 'shrine to the microwave' cabinet, set this cute little one in the corner where it occupies counter space that's unusuable anyway and gained several valuable square feet of cabinet storage on my wall. It does everything it needs to perfectly. No keypad? No problem. It's small but who roasts a turkey in the microwave?

In March of 2014 it started having the SE errors and similar to others on this site, would start on its own, night light would go off and on on its own, beep every 15 minutes, etc.<br />I tried all of the YouTube and other suggestions with removing the circuit board, cleaning all the connections. Originally this worked for two weeks, and then the problems restarted. Kept on repeating the process for the next 2 ½ months with the time interval getting shorter and shorter between cleanings.<br />The last time I left the power on when reinstalling the panel and the system worked fine. Oops, forgot to reinstall the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />Reinstalled the panel with the mounting bracket, again with live power and the SE error came on instantly.<br />Repeated the process three times, no errors without the circuit board mounting bracket; SE errors with the Circuit board mounting bracket.<br />With a large magnifying glass, I discovered a very, very small scratch on the ribbon cable between the circuit board and the control panel. This scratch lines up with a very sharp edge on the circuit board mounting bracket and it seemed that through vibration and general use; the ribbon cable was starting the have a direct contact between the embedded wires in the ribbon cable and the sharp edge of the mounting bracket, more than likely causing the strange SE errors.<br />I covered the sharp edge on the mounting bracket with electrician’s tape, as well as the ribbon cable where it bent around the mounting bracket projection.<br />Then while reinstalling the panel with live power, I tried twisting the panel, hitting it against the edge of the microwave, jiggling all the wires and all sorts of moves to see if the SE error would show up. No errors showed up.<br />The microwave has been working perfectly for two months now. It my case it is most likely that the manufacturing process was at fault for installing the ribbon cable tight against a sharp edge of the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />I would give this microwave 4 stars if it wasn't for the poor quality control during manufacturing.e manufacturing process was at fault for installing the ribbon cable tight against a sharp edge of the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />I would give this microwave 4 stars if it wasn't for the poor quality control during manufacturing.",2014-07-28

(We actually have the black version, but it is otherwise identical.)  The Samsung obviously shares the same basic design as the GE with a redesigned front panel.  I knew and trusted the Samsung brand from our personal electronics (such as several smartphones), so picked one of these up on sale at a local retailer.  Unfortunately, what I got was a bare-bones minimal redesign with major flaws.  It's like they took the basic GE design, made it super cheap, and replaced the panel with a terrible non-intuitive redesign.<br /><br />Installation was easy - I was even able to use the original rear mounting plate as the Samsung was, indeed, a twin of the GE series.  This microwave fit perfectly into our 30 wide opening with very minimal gaps on each side.  I had to drill new holes through the cabinet above, however, as the top was slightly different.  The height is 16 for the main cabinet, 16 5/8 to the very bottom of the light box underneath (not shown in the picture, but it's there).  I plugged it in and quickly realized that this sure isn't the same quality as the GE was.<br /><br />The first and most annoying thing is the user interface on the front panel.  The buttons are hard to interpret, and things that are easy on the GE are now impossible or very confusing.  Heating a beverage is common, right?  No beverage button on this unit - you need to discover the button to press is COOK, and then wait for the slowly scrolling text to confirm you are correct and need to press 1 next.<br /><br />What about canned vegetables?  There's a VEGGIES button, so this should be easy.  Not so!  Press the button, and across scrolls: SELECT ... (pause) ... 1 FOR ... (pause) ... FRESH ... (pause again) ... VEGGIES ... (um, I know it's vegetables, I just pressed the button!) ... 2 FOR ... (yet ANOTHER pause) ... FROZEN ... (darn, guess it must be 3) ... VEGGIES ... clear ... SELECT ... (oh no! where can frozen veggies be?!) ... etc.  At least the SELECT doesn't scroll when it appears, only when it's scrolling away.  But the worst part is seeing the VEGGIES on the display, alone, as I wait, knowing full well I pressed the veggies button.<br /><br />And I still have trouble figuring out which button is for the fan and which is for the light.  Making it worse is that there is one button for the light (HI/LO/OFF) and 2 buttons for the fan (ON/OFF and 4 speed).  Actually, there is another button each for some obscure settings we never use.  Sure, there are some tiny dark grey letters showing which set of button is which, but those are only visible up close in bright light.<br /><br />Gone are the easy 1-button 1 to 6 minute quick start buttons.  Now it takes 4 button presses to do the same thing, although at least there is still a button to add 30 seconds.  I could go on and on about the poor interface, but I think you get the idea.<br /><br />Next major issue: the stovetop light is way dimmer than the GE was.  Even though there are 2 places in the design for bulbs, and my GE had 2 halogen bulbs, this one has a SINGLE incandescent bulb - not bright at ALL.  This is huge, as we use our stovetop frequently and now it is always poorly lit.<br /><br />And a another biggie: when the timer finishes, it gives 4 short, quiet beeps, and stops.  No repeat, nothing more.  So unless you are right by it, it is pretty much worthless.  We can now only use our oven timer - so no more dual timers when we are cooking different things.  I can't even count how many things have overcooked or been ruined because of the lame timer.<br /><br />The look is also unattractive.  The lightbox hangs down below the lower front plastic panel, ensuring everyone knows how tacky this microwave is.  Even the display is an ugly old-fashioned blue 14-segment per digit 7-digit display.  Most calculators have better!  Actually, I kind of like the blue.  Everything else in my kitchen is amber, so it creates a nice contrast.<br /><br />Furthermore, it is noisy.  It frequently makes weird grinding-like noises from the bottom right (I think it is a fan or the microwave element) - if I tap it there it usually diminishes or goes away for a while.<br /><br />Finally, the front glass broke once when we were opening the door a couple of months after getting it.  Samsung did send out a repairman within 2 weeks and repaired it under warranty and it hasn't happened again in the many months since.<br /><br />Is there anything I like about this microwave?  Well, it works.  It has a turntable.  It has sensor cooking.  And it has dual grease-filters on either side of the bottom with a powerful exhaust fan (that has 4 levels when not using the microwave, 2 when in use).  It also has an easy-to-clean all-white interior.  And it was less expensive (on sale) than the similar GE units - but rightly so.<br /><br />PROS<br />It works.<br />Sensor cooking.<br />Dual grease filters.<br />Easily fits space replacing similar GE models.<br /><br />CONS<br />Horrible user interface.<br />Poor single-bulb incandescent stovetop lighting.<br />Loud, obnoxious noises.<br />Cheap looking.<br />Worthless kitchen timer.s amber, so it creates a nice contrast.<br /><br />Furthermore, it is noisy.

We have a GE in-cabinet microwave/oven combo unit so when the paint began to peel off the top of the microwave I was really worried because to replace this unit it is over $1000 due to it being a specialty item.  So I sanded down the top of the microwave really well.  Be sure to get ALL loose paint off - should be totally smooth.  Then when the paint arrived I shook it up real well and applied a coat to the top of the microwave.  It was actually a pretty good sized area I needed to cover.  After letting that coat dry for a couple hours I added a second coat and after a couple more hours I added a third coat.  I want to make sure it was coated good.  So far we have used it for a few weeks and it still looks great.  I showed it to my son and he said the inside looked brand new now!  I let it dry for 36 hours before use as the can didn't have any recommendations or directions for how long to let dry before use.  The smell is overwhelming and I would suggest using eye protection if you must use it inside as the fumes come out toward your face.  I would take a counter top unit outside to treat.

If you live in a small apartment, counter space is typically premium real estate and a microwave eats up quite a bit of that space. That was the case in our place. We had our old microwave on top of the refrigerator because we couldn't sacrifice what little counter space we had. That had its own problems because neither one of us is tall so reaching up with a spatula to remove a microwave dish had a few drop events. Not fun.<br /><br />Our old one recently conked out so off I went in search of a small unit. I saw this one and had a Eureka moment. Since it is only about 14 inches wide, I thought it would fit in the corner next to the coffee maker and once set up, it's great. It does take up space but there is now room for the essentials on the counter since this tucks nicely into the corner.<br /><br />The only issue that we had with this unit is that we have the old school laminated counter top in beige in our kitchen and sliding this into the corner resulted in black lines being drawn on the formica from the feet of the microwave. A magic eraser got rid of that.<br /><br />The other minor thing is that when on the laminate counter, the microwave slides when you try to open the door. They should have built this with non-slip feet. I cut a couple of squares of that non-slip grip stuff that's sold just about everywhere and that solved the problem.<br /><br />The inside of this unit is very small. Keep that in mind. It is a tall unit, but the cooking space is not conducive to a tall item. You can put a 4 inch call mug in there with no problem. I would not go above 5 inches in height for any item put in here. 5 1/2&#34; would leave only a very thin space at the top and I don't know how that would work out.<br /><br />These small things are well worth it to regain precious counter space.",2014-07-04

It still wasn't working. In the second service call we were instructed to turn the vent fan on manually when using the range top due to the microwave shutting down to avoid over-heating.  We immediately noticed that from that point on the microwave would not heat food unless the vent fan was running. (even if the stove was off and cold)  After the next service call, the microwave still wasn't heating food without the vent fan running despite the technician replacing a part and the microwave vibrating and humming whenever the vent fan was on after his repair.  We scheduled another service call.  The technician did not visit, stating that he had ordered a part that would solve the problem.

I bought this based on great reviews.  While it's a basic unit, which is what I wanted, it seems to be lacking in a couple of areas.  First, I didn't realize there were still microwaves that did not have instant-on for one minute when you press 1, two minutes for 2, and so on.  This doesn't do that.  Also, I knew it was big, but didn't realize it was going to be 2 inches taller and deeper than my old unit.  It's almost to the point of looking too big for the space.  Yes, i could have measured since the dimensions are listed.  My old oven had two lights underneath for lighting the range top.  This has one small bulb, and seems a little inadequate.  As others have said, I'm not sure if I'm sold on the upward facing vent.  It makes the front look clean, but seems like a funnel for things to fall into it.  The LED readout is big and blue, and while it's not unattractive, blue lights are blurry to me, so it's harder to read than my old green readout.<br /><br />On the plus side, this is a nice big, powerful microwave, that looks nice in the space.  It's got some nice touches, like a 30-minute fan-off timer.  Since I wanted a basic unit at a good price, which this is, I went ahead and gave it four stars.",2014-05-03

It would actually run, just would not heat the food.<br /><br />From extensive research, I figured out which components, when broken, would allow my microwave to run but just not heat.  The list below is from the most likely to least likely cause of the problem.<br /><br />1. Diode<br />2. Magnetron  [many times #1 & #2 happen together]<br />3. Capacitor<br />4. High Voltage Regulator<br />5. Control circuit board<br /><br />90%+ of the time it is #1 or #2 and most likely both.<br /><br />For me, it was both.<br /><br />When I ordered the above diode I tested it with an Ohm [volt] meter and a 9v batter.  The original had current both ways.  The new one allowed current only one way - that's the correct result.<br /><br />Tests on my old and new magnetrons with the Ohm meter had the same results (no battery needed for this).  Both tests read as a closed circuit (or 0.00 on my Ohm meter).  So I wasn't sure if the original Magnetron was actually broken or not.<br /><br />So to check this, I kept the old Magnetron installed and just installed the new diode (plenty videos on youtube on this).<br /><br />No heat. Problem NOT fixed.<br /><br />So then I replaced the Magnetron and kept the new diode in place. New Magnetron.  New Diode.<br /><br />Success.....my microwave works. Yay!<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />PS.  I ended up getting the an exact copy of the above Samsung OM75P(10) Magnetron for $52 (total final price)on another site.<br /><br />PSS.

Thats something I'll be talking to them about after the service tech comes out.<br /><br />Note Added 16/3/14:  I also reviewed microwave on Lowes.com last week but it was not published. Presumably they delete any negative reviews.  Will never trust that site again, after all, it was the positive reviews on that site that made me buy the thing in the first place.<br /><br />Update 17/3/14:  Service Tech came out and said it was the fan cover that caught fire.  The second one he's seen in this area in the past 2 weeks.  Luckily?? we were able to stop the flames before it melted anything but the fan cover itself.  So they are just replacing the fan cover.  Assured me it is a different model though.  They also told me that it happened because we were cooking popcorn (in a microwave popcorn popper) and it was too close to the ceiling.  But, we've used the exact same bowl in 3 different brands of microwaves over the past 10 years without a problem, so I just don't get it.<br />To my dismay, they didn't care about the burn marks on the ceiling of the microwave either.

You've got to be kidding me!","We bought this for our kitchen remodel to fit in the island in July 2012.

The heat from canning tends to melt the electronics in micros over the stove after about a few seasons.<br />Once it was in, I was never completely happy because it took a long time to reheat food and didn't seem to reheat evenly.  Not a big deal since we only used it for leftovers....and it looked good tucked away under the counter.<br />When I bought it, I couldn 't find many reviews on it - good or bad, but figured it would be fine-especially with the high price tag.<br />Wrong!<br />It just died with no warning.

The good:  It looks nice; the stainless steel finish must have some kind of coating on it because it's much easier to clean than some of my other steel appliances; the overall size is decent on the inside.  When it's cooking, I have to say this is the quietest microwave I've ever owned.    The not-so-good:  I've never had an over-the-range microwave with the handle on the door before and I hadn't really given that feature much thought before making the purchase.  It looks nice and all, but the handle gets untouchably hot if you're cooking on the stove;  I don't think I'd ever buy another with a handle again because it's kind of a nuisance to have to use an oven mitt to open the microwave (even more of a nuisance if I forget to use a mitt and put my hand on hot stainless steel).  It's very hard to see inside of when food is cooking.  There's one bulb and it's quite dim, plus the door has a screen-printed pattern on it that makes it even harder to see into.  The exhaust fan for the range technically has two settings, but they sound almost identical... and it's VERY loud. If the microwave is running for a long period of time or if it starts getting overheated from the stove below, the fan automatically turns on.  It's a smart feature to prevent it from overheating, but again the fan is super loud, and you can't manually turn it off once it kicks on.    The bad:  Oh. My. God.  The freakin' beeps when it's done cooking are INSANE!  I've never, ever had a microwave that didn't stop beeping upon the door being opened.  Not only does this continue, but the 3 beeps are extremely loud and at least 5-6 seconds long each!  And if you don't open the door in a timely fashion, it doesn't remind you with a gentle, short beep;  instead you get the same 3 ear-shattering YokoOno-screeching beeps every 2 minutes.  I've found that if you hit the stop/cancel button before opening the door, it'll stop the beeping... but again, it's another nuisance that I've never had to deal with in any previous microwaves.    The other bad thing I've found is that the touch pad scratches EXTREMELY easily.  I only use a microfiber cloth on it and it still looks like I went at it with steel wool covered in broken glass.  I tried using a plastic/fiberglass polish and it didn't do a thing.  However, I've found that using granite countertop cleaner/polish at least minimizes the look of the scratches a bit.    Overall, I'd advise people against purchasing this model.  Its negatives outweigh the positives... especially when there are so many other, better choices out there.",2014-02-25

This thing is a knockout!!","We've had the big 'ol &#34;over-the-range massive GE microwave that was powerful enough to cook a buffalo and was big enough to fit the beast inside but, when we redesigned our kitchen and put in a new pro-style stove and an elegant curved glass vent over it, that oversized radar box had to go! But what to get to replace it? Looked at all the allegedly compact countertop units and rejected every one of them -- &#34;compact&#34; they were not!<br /><br />And then we found this Whirlpool TV set, er, I mean microwave! Whomever designed this deserves a Nobel Prize for peace, physics and common sense!! It looks just like a cute little old school TV set. Imagine that! A cute microwave oven! But what's even better is how this thing disappears right into the corner of our new countertop. Somehow they figured out how to use the corner to their design advantage and here's the best: you can place a full-size 11&#34; dinner plate inside! How'd they do that??!!<br /><br />Negatives? Nothing terrible. Yes, it's only 750 watts vs the 1200 of our former &#34;beast-master&#34; machine but, as another reviewer said, just 'cause it fits a turkey and has the power to cook it doesn't mean ya should!! We use our microwave for vegetables, eggs, liquids, popcorn -- all of which the new cute Whirlpool TV/microwave thingee will do just fine. Takes an extra 15-30 seconds because of the lower power. That just gives me a little extra time to stare at this awesome box and marvel at how truly cool it is.<br /><br />And speaking of boxes, this is serious out-of-the-box thinking about appliances and how they fit into our lifestyles. Major kudos to Whirlpool for taking the initiative to see things a little different. Steve Jobs would have loved this microwave -- form and style perfectly matched with function. It's time for you other lazy manufacturers to up your game.<br /><br />Bottom line? Outstanding microwave!",2014-01-19

I really didn't like the way it functioned compared to previous microwaves I have owned. but it looked good, and worked fine; UNTIL YESTERDAY.<br /><br />Out of nowhere, it just went up in flames, it wasn't even in use at the time.<br /><br />The only one in the house was my 72 yr. old mother-in-law, she said she noticed earlier that morning, the display on the microwave was off and she was unable to use it (as if it was unplugged). A while later, the house filled with smoke. Smoke and  flames were shooting out of the top vent of the microwave. She said there was so much smoke she could not even see in the kitchen.  She called 911, the fire dept was dispatched, and she exited our home. By the time they arrived the fire had burned out on its own, and the damage was contained to the internals of the microwave. The fire crew removed the microwave from my home, and inspected the home to insure that the microwave was indeed the cause of the fire. Thankfully there was no damage to our home other than the microwave itself, and a strong odor of smoke and burnt plastic (I'm sure it will take weeks to get rid of the smell).<br /><br />I contacted Samsung, to report what happened and am awaiting a response from the Executive Customer Relations dept. do to the nature of the incident.<br /><br />I'm not really sure what I want from them, more than anything to create awareness. Maybe they will issue a recall, based on this and all of the negative reviews I have read here on Amazon. I would encourage others having problems with this model to report it to Samsung. It may not do you much good, but who knows, you could save a life or something.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/31/2014:<br />Samsung Executive Customer Relations department contacted me on 01/20/2014 (MLK Holiday), by telephone (cell phone). I was asked to provide the microwave serial number but did not have it with me, so we agreed that I would provide it via email. A short time later I received an email asking to provide the serial number as Samsung would like to locate a service center to diagnose the unit.  I responded later that day with the serial number.<br /><br />On 01/21/2014 I received a response which stated, based on the serial number provided, the microwave is out of warranty, but due to the nature of the problem Samsung will cover the cost of diagnostics, and a service center will contacting me.<br /><br />On 01/22/2014 I received a call from the service center informing me they received the service order from Samsung, but it states the microwave is out of warranty so I will be responsible for the payment, I asked them to double check with Samsung, but they said I would have to contact them. I sent an email explaining what the service center said, and a few hours later Samsung responded with a One time Accommodation for the labor which I assume was also sent to the service center.<br /><br />A few days later the service center contacted me again, explaining they received the accommodation from Samsung, and asked if I could deliver the microwave to them, which I agreed (they were only about 1 mile from my home).<br /><br />On 01/29/14 the service center contacted me to explain that several parts in the microwave short circuited, and required replacement.  They explained that the accommodation was for diagnostic labor only, and any further repair would be my responsibility.  They asked for direction; explaining that the parts required are expensive, and the repair would most likely exceed the cost of replacement.<br /><br />I sent another email to Samsung explaining the call from the service center.  I explained that I made it a point to buy appliances from well know major brands such as Samsung with the expectation of higher quality and long life.  I asked that given the fact the unit failed due to a short circuit, after such a short life, under normal residential use, that they consider replacing the microwave at no cost, despite the fact the warranty period had ended.

The size was great, and we liked the easy clean interior.<br /><br />However, six months after it was purchased (right before Christmas), it failed totally - would not power up at all.  I called Samsung customer service, they said a tech would get in touch shortly.  After 3 days a local repair company called to say they only came to our area once a week, so it would be several days before they could stop by.  We're 30 miles from Salt Lake City in Park City, a major resort town with a winter population of 100,000 people, so it's not like we're in the sticks.<br /><br />Nine days after I called, the repair service showed up.  He repaired one part, then stated that the magnetron was damaged, and that he would need to take the microwave to his shop for more diagnosis and repair.  Then he would have to order parts, then he would bring it back when his route brought him to our area again - so, two more weeks at least (assuming Samsung has the parts in stock).  On the way out of the door he banged the microwave into our door frame, putting a major dent in it.<br /><br />I called Samsung customer service again, and stated that I thought three weeks or more was too long to repair the unit.  They blamed the tech for not bringing all the parts he might need (what, a whole microwave?) but refused to offer to even expedite parts to the repair shop to cut a week off the time, let alone discuss any kind of replacement.<br /><br />With a family of 5, we use a microwave multiple times a day.  Samsung should have better quality in the first place.  When they have a failure, they need to have a better repair and support system in place, and if they can't do better than 3 weeks or more to repair an appliance that gets used daily, that's not good enough for me.  Do you need a failure like this right before you have family coming for the holidays? Would you be happy to spend weeks with a giant empty space in your kitchen where your microwave (and oven hood) was?<br /><br />We don't. No more Samsung appliances for us.  And good luck to Samsung in taking on Whirlpool, Bosch, Asko, Panasonic, etc. - the other appliances we have in our house which have worked great with daily use for years.  I'm off to the store for another brand of microwave, look for this one on eBay - still under warranty!<br /><br />By the way, we tried to post a version of this review (edited in accordance with Samsung.com's review guidelines) on Samsung.com, where Samsung supposedly allows customers to rate their products (and this microwave currently has a 4 star review).

We work from home and, one day, smelled smoke that we traced to our Advantium which was turned off and that had been turned off for some time. It was hot to the touch. We unplugged the Advantium and the the smoke smell went away: it had spontaneously turned on and was melting itself down. Plugging it back in turns it on without pressing any buttons. GE says this is not a fire hazard because there are supposed to be safety's to prevent it from burning down the house. I'm not so sure -- their credibility is shot -- but even if there are those safety's are built with the same low quality as the Advantium so cannot be reasonably relied upon. GE says the problem is with the keypad but that there aren't any more keypads to buy, probably because they all fail. The Advantium is a piece of junk. Save yourself money and protect your family from this potential fire hazard: avoid GE appliances.    [Update: after several calls and an eternity on hold GE acknowledged the problem and send a tech with a new Advantium that seems to be working well. I wouldn't buy another -- there are clearly QA issues with the Advantium -- but after lots of time on the phone GE did make this right.

Not intended to be installed above a range (standard ranges are 30&#34; wide), does not include a built-in hood for use above a range.<br />&#62; Has the great simple operation of previous Spacemakers: for example to heat a cup of coffee 1 minute, place it in the microwave and press &#34;1&#34;.  That's all.<br />&#62; Well built, albeit with more plastic and less metal than my old Spacemaker II.<br />&#62; Quieter than my old Spacemaker II--although that's no big deal.<br />&#62; The turntable is a nice addition (my old Spacemaker II did not have a turntable), but reduces the total space available (unless you turn the turntable off).<br />&#62; Has all of the controls and options of my old Spacemaker II:<br />...Plus popcorn, &#34;beverage&#34;, &#34;reheat&#34;, &#34;chicken/fish&#34;, &#34;potato&#34;, and &#34;vegetable&#34; buttons (which I probably won't use because I like to know what the microwave is doing).<br />...Other new buttons are &#34;delay start&#34;, &#34;reminder&#34;, &#34;turntable on/off&#34;, and &#34;add 30 sec&#34;.  The &#34;add 30 sec&#34; works on its own, you can press it and get just 30 seconds OR add 30 seconds to any time.  30 seconds is ideal for warming a cup of coffee, or heating some pastries.<br />...There is a child lockout, but without a dedicated button.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION<br />&#62; The microwave itself comes with a paper template for drilling the necessary holes, but the template can be confusing and may not apply in all cases.<br />&#62; The microwave hangs from four ~1 1/4&#34;-long machine screws, which are inserted from above, from inside the cabinet above.  If the floor of the cabinet is greater than 1/2&#34; thick, then the length of the screws needs to be equal to the thickness of the floor plus 1/2&#34;.<br />&#62; Hypothetically, you could install the microwave with the four screws from your local hardware store, and 4 big washers (e.g., 2&#34; in diameter).  However the installation kit is probably easier.<br />&#62; If you use the template, double check the logic, and adjust the location of the screw holes accordingly.<br />... The key measurement is the distance from the front holes to the front of the cabinet. You usually want the front of the microwave to be flush with the front of the closed doors of the cabinet.  (That is, the front holes should be approximately 3 1/4&#34; back from the front of the closed doors).<br />... The door of the microwave needs an extra 1/8&#34; on the left in order to open fully, and the grill for the ventilation fan is on the left side of the microwave.  If there is an obstruction on the left side (such as wall, cabinet, or refrigerator), you may wish to shift the holes 1/4&#34; to the right, if you can.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION KIT<br />&#62; If this is an new undercounter installation, or the space between the front and back screw holes (inside the cabinet above the microwave) is not ~6 1/4&#34;, then you need GE part #WX4-A019 [[ASIN:B001H815TO GE Part Number WX4-A019 UNDER CAB MT]].  If you are replacing a Spacemaker with a distance of ~6 1/4&#34; between the front and back holes, then you probably do NOT need an installation kit.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE REPLACING AN OLD SPACEMAKER II (for which the spacing between the front and rear screw holes is ~7 3/4&#34;)...<br />&#62; I purchased this Profile Spacemaker to replace a 23-year old Spacemaker II.  But neither the holes, backing plate, nor the screws were the same.<br />&#62; The spacing from the cabinet front to the forward screw holes is almost the same for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; The lateral spacing (side-to-side) between the screw holes is the same 19 15/32&#34; for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; But the spacing between the front and rear holes is NOT the same (the new spacing is 6 1/4&#34;).<br />&#62;So, if the holes in your cabinet are for the old Spacemaker II, then you need only drill new rear holes in your cabinet for this Profile Spacemaker.  Draw a line on the cabinet between the centers of the existing front and back holes, measure 6 1/4&#34; back from the center of the front hole, and drill the new hole there.<br />&#62; The screws seem to be very similar, but a slightly different diameter or pitch (perhaps they are metric). Hypothetically, you could drill new holes in the old backing plate (or use washers instead of the backing plate), and find screws the right size and length, but I decided to purchase the new kit instead.<br /><br />BEFORE YOU REPLACE A DEAD MICROWAVE OVEN ...<br />&#62; My old Spacemaker II died three times over 23 years as the result of power surges (lightning).  I accidentally learned that the trick is to unplug the microwave overnight for the electronics to reset.  I've had the same experience with several other appliances.<br />&#62; Even refrigerators and clothes driers have built-in computers these days.  If any electric appliance is not working properly, unplug it, and leave it unplugged a while.  For some reason (perhaps large capacitors in the circuit) big appliances usually need hours to reset.<br /><br />RELIABILITY<br />If my experience with my old Spacemaker II is any indication, this Profile Spacemaker should be very reliable.  Although resurrected 3 times over 23 years, my old Spacemaker was still working when I &#34;took it out of service&#34;.  After 23 years of daily use, some of the white finish was turning yellow, there were patches of rust inside, and the door switch (which turns the light on and off) was erratic.<br /><br />IF YOUR OLD SPACEMAKER HAD A TRAY INSTEAD OF A TURNTABLE, keep the tray from your old microwave.<br />&#62; The tray will fit in your new Profile Spacemaker.  The tray will catch spills and protect the bottom of the microwave from abrasion and burnt-on spills (which may promote rust in the future).<br />&#62; I use the glass tray when I'm using a large rectangular casserole, or many small containers.  I often warm two 12&#34; diameter full plates of food---I use a small glass storage container as a spacer so that the plates can overlap.<br />&#62; If you use the tray, lift out the glass turntable and rollers and turn off the turntable drive, then place the glass tray in the bottom.<br /><br />GENERAL HINTS ON MICROWAVE COOKING<br />It is largely steam created by the microwaves which does the cooking, so the key to cooking many items (especially vegies) is to generate and hold that steam.<br />&#62; If you are warming bread, wrap it in a towel.

If the vegies are dehydrated after long storage, you may want to soak them a few hours ahead to time to re-hydrate them.<br />&#62; It is usually best NOT to boil vegies in a container of water in a microwave, because the excess formation of steam LOWERS the cooking temperature.

We gave up preservative laden pre-packaged bags of popcorn years ago in favor of real kernels using a special bowl or paper bag, so the popcorn setting is useless for us.

In performance and style, this Whirlpool microwave is absolutely superior. A few notes:<br /><br />- Heats faster and more evenly than I'm used to. Depth is 17 inches, which is one inch larger than my old microwave. Thus, I'm able to use my large square plates in this one.<br /><br />- Install was a bit tricky. I installed in a slot previously occupied by a microwave, so I did not have to cut a vent hole or locate studs. I did have to remove the old mounting plate, which was shorter. This unit came with a cardboard template to locate the bottom line of the mounting plate on the wall. This wall template worked fine - I simply drew the line, then held up the metal plate, and drilled into the studs in the appropriate holes.<br /><br />The top template was a different matter. Whirlpool provides a paper template to affix to the underside of your cabinets to locate the holes to drill for the cabinet mount. If you have a recess under your cabinets, as I do, you will need to trim the template to get it to fit. I did this, and drilled through the template holes. They were about a half inch off. I threw the template away and remeasured, and drilled 9 1/2 from the back wall (not 10 as specified in the installation instructions). These holes worked.<br /><br />The power cord also has to go through the cabinet above. The instructions say to bore a 1.5-inch hole. I did this with a spade bit (enlarging a ~.75 inch hole from the old microwave). Seems a bit large, could probably have gotten away with a 1 inch hole.<br /><br />I have the microwave wall-vented. Installing the flap with sheet metal screws on the microwave and placing into my pre-existing vent hole was easy. I can't speak to the ease of the ceiling vent mount.<br /><br />- There are presets for popcorn, potator, and pizza. Of these, I've only used the pizza setting to reheat a small slice. Took 1 minute 40 seconds on a lower setting,but heated it a bit too hot. Would probably be fine for a large slice.<br /><br />Other than that, it looks and works great.",2013-11-13

A few weeks later I see it on sale from its already great price and bought it $230.  It sticks out about an inch more beyond my cabinets than the ge did but I think this is intentional as the exhaust vent blows out of the top toward the front of the unit.  This actually provides better coverage when cooking on the stove top as well since everything rises right up into the vent hood.  It's been a year and a half and it still works great.  It's just as powerful as the ge was so either it's under rated or the ge was over rated in wattage.  For under 300 bucks you can't go wrong with this microwave.

It was fairly inexpensive and looks good in the kitchen.  Observations in no particular order:<br /><br />1. The sensor cooking on this is much better than on our old Sharp countertop unit, which overcooked everything.  I had thought at the time that it would be nice if there was a way to calibrate the sensor.  While the Samsung doesn't give you calibration options, it does let you say what you are cooking, and apparently adjusts its response to the sensor accordingly.  I have found that it works pretty well to always tell it I'm reheating pasta!<br /><br />2. A general-use kitchen timer is provided.  Of course most microwaves do, so that's not unusual, but this one is smarter than some.  It is able to function independently of the cooking timer.  For example, if you are timing something for 30 minutes, then decide partway through you want to heat a cup of water for one minute, it will correctly keep track of the 30 minute timer in the background and display it again after it's done with the water.<br /><br />3. Minor niggle: the oven vent is supposed to come on whenever it detects heat rising from below, but ours seems to always need to be turned on manually.<br /><br />4. This is where the Samsung loses a review star.  The Eco Mode feature is poorly conceived.  When you press the button, the panel lights go out and standby power consumption is reduced.  So far, so good.  But then as as soon as you use the microwave again, or even just open the door, or use the oven light or vent options, it leaves eco mode; the display comes back on and STAYS on.  It really should remember eco as a user preference rather than as a temporary mode.  I also suspect this ties in to the problems some customers have had with the control panel failing.  If we were allowed to set a persistent eco mode, it's likely that the front panel would be mostly-off except when in actual operation, and as a result it might not burn out.  We have made it a habit to push the eco button after each use.<br /><br />In sum, it fits with our kitchen decor and cooks well, and we hope we will be able to make it last a long time by remembering the eco button as often as possible.",2013-10-12

You can open the door, but it still beeps;  you can not push the stop button, because until the beep is done - NOTHING ELSE WORKS -  This thing is robbing my time a few seconds at a time.<br /><br />Who is the Frigidaire executive that pushed this forward with out simple end user testing?<br /><br />Skip it...

Saves us energy by allowing us to bake many foods without having to use our stove's larger gas oven and it works quickly. Only two &#34;observations&#34; we have are: 1. Touch Pad is very difficult to see in normal light. Attractive design, but near impossible to read as the gray typeface on black background is horrible choice. Not a big change for GE to make, surprised that engineering has not yet ordered such an important and easy revision. This may well be a safety and/or frustrating issue for some persons.

For pretty  much everything, it requires too many key strokes to get it doing what you want. It's like the old days of operating a VCR. way too complicated. It's like you have to keep the manual out on the counter if you want to do anything other than run if for 1, 2 or 3 minutes.  defrosting = difficult .. timer = difficult... resetting the clock = difficult<br />In summary: as long as your key objective is to get the microwave off of the counter, and you only plan on using it to reheat things at max heat, then you will love it.",2013-08-29

Found out this is the exact same appliance as the Dacor, at half the price. So we ordered this one, but returned it immediately because it  had dents, so obviously had been dropped, and seemed to be making a louder noise than the old Dacor when operating and I was afraid it had internal damage. Amazon was as always good on making full refund on its return. I then came across a highly discounted floor model microwave that featured a 400 cfu exhaust system (vs the 300 cfu exhaust on this product), a feature very important to my wife who does a lot of stir frying. The microwave I bought is also 1100 watts vs 850 watts on this one, but I don't know how important an extra 250 watts really is. 850 watts was just fine for us for  10 years.  Could it be the lower wattage helped it last so long?

One word of advice if you buy this and vent it to the outside, remove the vent flap on top of the unit and install a vent flap at the end of the duct line. Our vent flap became loaded with grease and stuck in the closed postion. The exhaust  then entered and covered the wiring and internal parts with grease, causing it to overheat and blow the magnitron. Also be religious about keeping the vent screens clean.

It looks like a professional food service microwave. To me, the stainless steel interior is easier to clean than a white painted one.<br /><br />We have heard that microwave ovens don't last like they used to (we have one low quality unbranded OTR one in a mobile home at the moment which was new in 1995 & still working as well as it ever did, and another LG 900 watt in an RV from 2004, also a good runner at this writing, July 2013).<br /><br />We didn't want to spend a lot of money if the microwave was only going to last a couple of years. Well, with this Danby, we have a two year replacement warranty. If it dies before its time, we either get a new one or a refund of the money we spent on this one. Fair enough, I thought.<br /><br />There are not a lot of features here and it isn't super powerful. Certainly adequate but our LG 900 watt heats things up a bit faster and has more useful programs like casserole re-heat with 4 levels and programs for either fresh or frozen vegetables with different quantities.<br /><br />The Danby reheat button has only 3 minutes; no other options. For most cooking/reheating you have to punch in the time you guess is about right manually.<br /><br />Considering the price ($100 Canadian plus sales tax) and the two year replacement warranty ($10 from Wal Mart), we are pretty well pleased with this so far.

I just love how it looks in the corner of my kitchen. The only negative to me is that it's kind of expensive for a small microwave, but what was the last thing you bought for your kitchen that just made you happy? Since the only con I can think of is the price, I'll just run through the pros as I see them.<br />1. It's unique. Every other microwave I've ever seen (with the exception of the Sharp Half-Pint) looks pretty much the same: a horizontal rectangle with a door and a keypad control panel to the right. The bottom controls and lack of numeric pad make this thing look entirely different, and in a good way. (Don't worry about the lack of a keypad, the controls are a no-brainer.) When you unbox it and see the rounded back, you know you've bought something different from the norm.<br />2. It's big inside. Bigger than my old GE compact for round things, and I've just never had the urge to throw a 9x13 pan in my microwave. (I have yet to try it with popcorn, manual says limit it to the 1.75 ounce size.)<br />3. It's powerful. 1:30 on high heats up a cup of water better than my old one. Good enough for me.<br />4. The LED display is blue. Very cool, in my opinion.<br />5. The interior light goes on when you open the door. Some small microwaves only light up while you're cooking.<br />6. You can use the timer and cook simultaneously. Pretty standard, but some don't. Also, you can adjust the timer and the cook time on the fly by hitting + or -, no need to stop and reset. And you can toggle between the timer and the clock if you want.<br />7. No door release button. You just grab the recessed edge of the door and pull. And it feels solid when you shut it.<br />8. The reminder tone shuts off. Yes, it reminds you when you forget to pull something out, but it shuts up after three reminders and reverts to the clock. (I swear my old microwave displayed End most of the time.)<br />9. Limited features.The only special features are defrost, reheat, popcorn, and power level (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and the power-saving 0%). I've never used anything more.<br />10. I'm running out of ideas, but to make a nice round 10, I'll point out that the door is about two inches thick with a space between an inner and outer window. This gives it a kind of window-box look that I like a lot.<br />Hope this helps convince everybody to pull the trigger and buy this microwave. You won't regret it!<br />NOTE: The display panel comes covered in a clear plastic film that is pretty easy to miss when you're unpacking. I didn't see it and was highly alarmed after a couple of days when the start button started to look and feel cracked! Further investigation revealed the protective film, which easily peeled off to reveal a pristine panel underneath.",2013-07-03

Some SS Steel parts magnetic.","I just installed this item. Be careful with the lag screws provided. They are tin like and do strip out no matter what and cannot be loosened or tightened once the head strips. They require a special flat nose phillips head but that did not help. Buy some quality mounting screws as $ 500.00+ is not enough for GE to include those, and I hope the rest of the unit is not as cheap as the mounting screws. Pollute the planet and make a extra trip to the hardware store. Second, I was leveling the microwave and son of a gun, the magnet on my level stuck to the inside of the unit, which is supposed to be stainless steel. I would still prefer whatever this stuff is to the plastic interior that comes with non-convection. The templates were perfect and put all the screws in the correct locations. You need to order the charcoal filter if you are using the recirculate rather than outside vented feature. To recirculate, you must unscrew 3 screws on top rear and rotate the fan housing 90 degrees before you install the unit. You also need to remove 2 screws on the upper front trim and slide in the filter then replace the trim. My 15 year old did both. You need to butt the top of the unit to the shelf above, or insert trim pieces around the top. If you don't, and let it hang even 1/2 inch, the unit can rise up if hit and fall off the shallow rear flanges that hold it to the back wall bracket and fall onto the new matching GE range. Our cabinets had a wierd from the 1960's lip on one side (I like old school stuff) and I needed to add the trim to prevent falling. The unit powered on and worked once we finished. Will update after a few months of use. I am a licensed electrical and general contractor, so I hope this helps in getting it ready to install. Took my son and I about an hour. The unit looks great in the kitchen. After months of research, it was between this and the Sharp, but this had more power and capacity, and there was not a Sharp in any showroom for QC comparison.

I will say the microwave works well as far as successfully heating items as a microwave should. Other than that, I find it to be an awkward design in the following ways:<br /><br />- The button for the light is directly under the &#34;Start&#34; button. If you hit the &#34;Start&#34; button, it automatically starts microwaving for 30 seconds. However, in a dimly-lit room, I often accidentally hit the &#34;Start&#34; button when I'm just trying to turn the light on. I can' tell you how many times I have started a 30-second microwave cycle on an empty microwave.<br />- Speaking of the lights there are two light bulbs underneath, which is fine. However, in the one year we've been using this microwave, the same bulb has burned out twice, while the other has yet to burn out at all. The first time, we had to scour the internet for a replacement bulb only to find that the specific wattage of the bulb that came in the microwave is pretty much unavailable. Anywhere. So we did some reading and learned to use a slightly lower wattage bulb. This took entirely too much research and hunting for what should have been a simple light bulb.<br />- The beeping at the end of the cooking (or timer) is quite obnoxious. It's 3 long, loud beeps, and, unlike every other microwave I've ever used, it does NOT stop when you open the microwave door! I have young children and often stand directly in front of the microwave, waiting for the timer to hit 1 second so I can stop it before it beeps so it doesn't wake up anyone sleeping/napping.<br />- There are lots of &#34;convenience&#34; setting (quick buttons), but I have never used a single one of them. Seems like a bit of a waste of space and features. It has a &#34;reheat&#34; button, but, unlike some other microwaves on the market, it is NOT a &#34;sensor&#34;/automatic reheat, so I'm not sure what the purpose of it is when you could just as easily enter the amount of time and hit start like normal.<br /><br />Overall, it looks nice enough and works as far as microwaving is concerned, but I personally think it comes with many flaws.",2013-03-06

Pros:  a major consumer magazine rates Whirlpool tops in reliability.  At its price this is, as expected, a pretty basic microwave, but fulfills our needs.  It heats well, is (in black) quite attractive, the microwave and fan are quiet, controls are convenient for basic operations.  Cons:  one of the installation templates is printed on the cardboard packaging, the edges of which shred when cut, making the template difficult to use accurately.  The bolts supplied will not work in a deep cabinet and it took trips to four hardware stores to find longer replacements.  The instructions did not include an option to hardwire the electrical connection, so I had to swallow hard and cut the cord without knowing what I'd find once I had (turned out not to be a problem).  I exhausted through the wall, but there's an outlet for internal exhaust, and it opens upwards towards the ceiling.  And I mean OPENS.  There's no grid to keep small objects from falling into the body of the microwave from the cabinet above.  This is atrocious design!  I used some semi-rigid plastic screen and clear silicone sealant to protect this area.  The user instructions which come with the oven are totally inadequate, and Whirlpool's website doesn't seem to have any more.  Just as an example, it says to touch COOK, enter the number code of food item, enter quantiy, then touch the Start control.  But there's no list of food item codes.  I'd still recommend the microwave for those who are willing to deal with these issues.<br /><br />Update:  I contacted Whirlpool:  It turns out the food item codes are behind the door.  I guess I should have noticed, but it would be nice if the user instructions referenced this.  As I wrote above, they are very cursory.",2013-02-20

I brought it home, removed the older microwave this was replacing and installed this new one, myself. (Installation was a bit more difficult than I expected it to be, but this had more to do with the shoddy installation of the unit it was replacing than any flaws in this unit, so I won't count that as a strike against this product.)<br /><br />In the few months that we have been using this unit, there are several things that I've noticed that have made me regret this purchase:<br /><br />1. The glass plate split in two after about two weeks of use. I have no idea why this occured. My wife stuck in a bowl of oatmeal to cook it and after about 30 seconds there was a loud bang and she turned it off to see what had happened. The glass plate was spilt into two pieces, nearly right down the middle. Weird. The replacement part cost me another $30. Not happy about this!<br /><br />2. The venting fan has a flap that opens to the duct inside the wall. The hinge on this flap is very weak and we can hear it flapping about on windy days. This seems very irregular, as the kitchen wall this unit is mounted on is an inside wall, not an exterior wall, and the ductwork goes up through the roof, not to the nearest exterior wall. I really don't think it should do this. The last unit did not do this, and it's a bit irritating to hear this flap rattling and squeaking around on windy days.<br /><br />3. This microwave positively will not cook a good bag of microwave popping corn. What's up with that? Isn't that a basic necessity of EVERY microwave? Put in a bag of popping corn and you either get 25% of it popped with wet, greasy kernels or 75% popped and it's all burned brown and stinky. The first few times I figured my wife was losing her mind and just counldn't figure out the new unit. Well, I have now tried four different brands of popping corn and got the same results with all brands. For a family that really enjoys microwave popping corn, this was a real bummer, and the number one reason I would never recommend this microwave to another person.<br /><br />4. In general terms, this microwave seems underpowered. It claims to have the same wattage cooking power as the model it replaced, but I'm not seeing it. Everything takes longer to cook with this unit. Sure, in microwave terms, you're only talking about 15% longer cook times which equal out to mere seconds or a few more minutes, so it's not a lot of extra time, but it's just worse than I expected. You always kind of assume that the new model will be better than the old, but that just wasn't the case, in this instance.<br /><br />5. OK, this one is just personal preference and not really a problem with the unit. (I probably should have inquired about this feature before purchasing this product.) I prefer microwaves that you just pop food into, press the seconds (or minutes) you want to cook something and then press start. On this unit, you need to press a button marked cook time before you start pressing any numbers. If you press any number at the start, the unit powers up and begins cooking the food by the number of minutes assigned to that number button on the number pad. Some people may be used to this types of microwave. I am not, so I prefer the aforementioned method of cooking food. I don't need auto-programmed cook times assigned to my numbers.<br /><br />Overall, generally displeased with this model and would NEVER recommend it to anyone.e results with all brands.

The keypad also broke one day, and when I called to get it fixed they came out the next day and replaced the whole thing--apparently it happens so often they have a few of them just sitting around as replacements.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars because, while it is prone to breaking, it is at least a really functional/attractive microwave and we didn't have to pay very much on a replacement. If you only need a microwave for 1 year or less, it's a good buy. Any longer, which will be most people, find a different brand.",2012-12-03

The problem I encountered was that after owning it for about a year and a half, it suddenly stopped working.  I'd set the time and hit start, the light inside would come on, the clock would count down, but neither the turntable would turn nor would the microwave actually start cooking.<br />I drove it to a Sharp certified technician, and about $65 later, it worked fine.  At least, for another year or so.  Repeated the process, paid another $65, and then it worked fine. This time, for another year.  Thanks to the economy, my Sharp certified technician lost his business, and now I had to drive it over an hour away if I wanted it fixed.<br />I brought it to a Sears service center, where they fixed it for about $50, and they said there was a problem with some kind of safety latch with the door.  This time, it lasted about 6 months.  I agree with other users, that every microwave on the market has some kind of issue.

Needs a recall, but Whirlpool does not care.","This microwave was selected during a KB HOME build for our new home over 2 years ago (Summer 2010).  The microwave indicated that it was manufactured in April 2010.  Low and behold the microwave would start shutting down by itself when I hit start beginning about June 2012.  A few days ago it just stopped working completely.  No pop, no fizzle, no crackle - it just wouldn't heat up anything.  Whirlpool dispatched a 3rd-party repair person and he stated that the magnetron was bad (or dead?).  He was fairly certain it was a recall item.  The repair person estimated that, absent a recall, it would cost $450 to fix. The service appointment itself was $89.  The following day, the repair service left a voice-mail stating that it was not a recall item, but that I should verify it with Whirlpool .<br /><br />I contacted Whirlpool (1-800-253-1301) and the customer service rep stated that it wasn't their problem once the standard 12-month warranty had elapsed.  The rep said there was no recall for the magnetron.  I escalated the matter to a supervisor.  All the supervisor did was reiterate that Whirlpool wasn't going to do anything past the 12-months.  The supervisor then offered to sell me one of four new microwaves at a VIP rate.  Of course the rate was not VIP at all once you added the deliver ($70) and the installation ($45) charges (so for being screwed over, I was a VIP?).  It goes without saying that I didn't take her up on the offer(s).<br /><br />Needless to say, I was very upset and immediately Google'd the model number in the hope of finding out more info on the problem and perhaps locating a cheaper replacement for the microwave.  And that, my friends, is how I ended up here on Amazon and saw that 29 other reviewers before me also had issues with this particular microwave.  I got a certified lemon.<br /><br />What are my options at this point?  A class action lawsuit?  A complaint to the state Attorney General's office? I don't know. What I do know is that Whirlpool is aware of the problem and could not care less.  I'm out of $600 (or more) and  I'm left reheating stuff in the oven now.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE.",2012-11-21

I was not the original purchase of this particular appliance, and it was over 10 years old.<br /><br />So I began looking for product replacement.  I found a Whirlpool model online that had some nice ratings, but when I went to my local big box store to purchase, they didn't have the exact Whirlpool model I had read about.  What I found, was this model, which I assume is the newest version.<br /><br />The microwave has a very nice finish.  The door and front feel fairly sturdy.<br /><br />Operation is simple.  I tend to hate overly complex controls.  I want power and simple controls.  This microwave meets my needs in this regard.  This microwave has lots of power.<br /><br />Now the bad.  The install.  This is my second microwave install.  My first being a retrofit of an over the range fan.<br /><br />My first install, and noticing the hardware of my current broken microwave.  The units are mounted by a rear wall bracket that holds the bottom part of the microwave.  And the top of the microwave is held by a couple of suspension bolts fixed to the cabinet.  The USUAL location of these bolts are the two front corners of the microwave.<br /><br />The rear bracket is usually the same size/shape as the rear of the microwave.  This makes it fairly easy to just place the bracket on the rear wall and push up until the bracket touches the cabinet.  No measurement really necessary.  This Microwave has a small bar hanger.  So you'll need to be very accurate with a measuring tape to figure out where the bottom of the Microwave will sit against the wall.<br /><br />I tend to not trust myself in this regard.  So I taped the bracket to the bottom of the microwave.  Held the microwave up against the wall, and had a helper draw a marking line with a pencil.<br /><br />The second negative.  Usually the suspension bolts are at the front corners of the microwave.  In mounting position, my current defective microwave has boltsin the corners.  I could have taken the other microwave from my other house and I suspect the holes are in the same position.<br /><br />On this microwave, one bolt is about 3 inches in from the edge (which is slightly offset).  The second bolt is about 7 inches in so it is offset quite a bit.  Both holes did not line up with my current microwave mounting holes.  So to mount this microwave I had to drill new holes in my cabinet.<br /><br />So take this into consideration.  I bought my unit as a floor model return.  I suspect it was returned for this very reason.<br /><br />Otherwise I've been happy with this purchase so far.",2012-11-04

I got the white one because my counters are white and it is so cute, just nestled into that small space. The best part is that it really works well. We feared making popcorn, which the Haier never, and I mean never, did well. Always burnt no matter what we tried. This Whirlpool made perfect popcorn at 2 1/2 minutes. We snack on it every night and the bag fits in perfectly with room to spare. It will fit a dinner plate easily and heats evenly. There is a 30 second button, start, stop, and a clock that also doubles as a timer. We have never used the auto buttons. I would buy this again in a minute.",2012-10-08

In May I noticed that when I opened the door of the microwave it appeared to have a short (a bright light flashed then went out).  It still heated but as I thought it might be a fire hazard I contacted Samsung.  They set me up with a service repair company that had a poor rating on Angie's list.  A guy came out, dismantled it and said a key part needed to be replaced (he noted 'switches' on the service order dated May 15th).  He said it would take 3-5 days so he came back a week later, without the part, saying he just need to tighten some wires.  It worked for a few weeks, then started to heat only intermittently.  Called the service company again, and a guy came out and jiggled the door, saying there was a problem with the switches, but that they didn't need to be replaced.  It worked again for a few weeks, where I had to keep jiggling the door, and finally stopped heating altogether.  Now, knowing that there was a problem with the switches, I expected the guy to arrive with the needed part.  He came but again, no part, saying he just wanted to confirm it was the switches and that the part had already been ordered.  After not hearing anything for a few weeks, I called back and was told that 'Sharp parts were backordered'.  When I told her it was a Samsung, she didn't look up my order but just said she would look into it and call me back.  After not hearing anything again, I called back and she said the same thing (Sharp is back-ordered, correction it's Samsung)and said she would call me back.  Again didn't hear back so called Samsung.  The escalation department reviewed the situation and I was put in for an exchange because the process had gone on so long.  She said I would get a call from someone who would review options with me (when I asked what the options would be she didn't know--why is that?).  Instead, I got a call from Samsung a week later saying that the servicecompany had miraculously received the part and they wanted to schedule a service call.  I told her I had been put in for an exchange and she insisted that I again deal with this disreputable service company.  I refused, and since I didn't have the Transaction # she said she would call me back today.  She didn't call this morning when she said she would so I called Samsung.  Just got off the phone with Samsung, who refuses to replace my microwave.  It just seems to be a game of stringing customers along with vague and misleading promises.  The only 2 service companies they have for this area have F ratings on Angie's list.<br />I had a similar situation occur with my 1 month old stove back in December, which broke on Xmas Eve.  After 3 months of fighting with Samsung Best Buy finally felt sorry for me and gave me a new stove.<br />After spending thousands of dollars on Samsung appliances I expected more from Samsung.<br />I would stay away from Samsung or if you do purchase an appliance from them, get an independent warranty.

Installation: Problematic.","I had an older GE microwave above my range that died after about 8 years. When looking for a replacement I decided to go for another similar GE in order to swap it out easily, figuring it would use similar hardware. That was my first mistake.<br /><br />There's a steel plate used to mount the oven on the wall plus three big screws that go in from the cabinet on top. Not only is the plate different (requiring removal of old & installation of the new), not only are the anchor points in different places (requiring new holes), but they're placed just marginally off the old anchor points. Meaning that the integrity of the wood where you need to drill is compromised from the old screw holes. It required me to install a whole new shelf in the upper cabinet as well as trying my best to fill the old stud holes with wood filler and hoping it would be strong enough when I re-drilled.<br /><br />Here's the kicker... the installation hardware comes with butterfly screws as well as two thick wood screws for mounting to the wall studs. Unfortunately, those two wood screws are made of very cheap & weak metal. I pre-drilled guide holes as per the instructions, but when it came to screwing the screws in- the heads twisted right off on both of them (and I was extra careful with the second one after the first one broke).  The screws were already 3/4 of the way in, leaving me with no way to remove them and blocking the ability to try again in the same spot (a spot required for proper installation).  The oven isn't light, the installation requires heavy duty hardware, why ship the microwave with such crappy screws?<br /><br />Lessons:<br /><br />Buy your own mounting hardware.<br />When it comes to buying a replacement appliance, there's no value in nepotism.",2012-06-18

Then, if you get past that, there is a long period where the odds of your product failing is very low, until end of life is reached, maybe 10 to 20 years later.  The people who write reviews in Amazon are the unfortunate ones who products fail during that initial period.<br /><br />My microwave broke after 4 months.  But, GE customer service is great.  I called them up.  They came to my house the same day.  It needed parts the repair did not have on his truck.  He ordered the parts, which came 2 days later.  I made another appointment and my microwave was back in a week.<br /><br />This microwave is big inside.  I don't know how imporantant that is.  We can put big plates or platters in it.  But, if it wasn't so big, I could just put the food in smaller bowl.<br /><br />It has lots of heating options.  But, so do the cheapest microwaves.  Personally, I don't think any of those heating options are of any value.  It is not like they are reliable to work automatically.  With any microwave, you experiment a couple of times and then you konw what setting to use.<br /><br />Really, there are only 3 important features for amicrowave:<br /><br />1.  How it looks.  I think this looks great.<br /><br />2.  Power.  This is 1200 watts and heats food fast.  I wouldn't get anything under 1000 watts.<br /><br />3.  Quality.  Unfortunately, I don't think you can do much about this.",2012-04-29

I selected it mainly due to the price (less than 60 bucks at walmart) and the fact that it takes up little counter space. Although I was not expecting much in terms of features, I've been really impressed with this.<br /><br />It offers a wide range of programming features. There are 6 one-touch buttons so you can set 1 to 6 minutes of cooking time with one key press. It also has an add 30 seconds feature that can be used at start-up or while the microwave is already running. There are also a host of timing options for cooking and defrosting.<br /><br />It looks really nice - much better than I was expecting. Pretty decent stainless steel trim on the front and the handle, and a black casing. Looks like it cost a lot more. Easy to clean, and the handle keeps fingerprints away from the front. One difference from the picture -- the key pad is all black, and not white and black as in the photo.<br /><br />The 0.9 capacity is just right. I also have a 0.7 capacity machine, but that has a problem with any dish that's larger than 11 inches. The 0.9 gives you a decent amount of interior space, but doesn't take up much more counter space than the 0.7.<br /><br />It has 900 watts of power, and does a good job of heating foods quickly. The interior light is bright and comes on when the unit is running or the door is open. Reasonably quiet when it is running - typical noise level for a microwave.<br /><br />Can't speak to reliability as of yet, but it comes with a 12 month warranty that is extended to 18 months if you register it online.<br /><br />Great machine if you're looking for something that is small, but still very usable. Highly recommend.",2012-04-24

It is somewhat louder than the old one. It makes a humming noise when running. All make some noise, but this is almost annoying.<br /><br />At 900 watts you can expect moderate cook times. The table turns slower than others. The old one made one revolution in 10 seconds. This one takes about 13+ seconds.

There aren't that many drawer microwaves available.  Why buy a drawer microwave?  Well, the most important reason is that my wife wanted one in our new house!  Her arguments were as follows:  1) no need to lift or inspect foods over her head, 2) made space for a vent. While microwaves can generally be vented from the front or the above (top), our new house didn't have any vent.  So, all cooking fumes were vented into the room.  With this oven, we removed the cabinet above the existing microwave and installed a stainless steel vent hood (above the range).  Still, not perfectly ventalated.  I had to modify a base cabinet near the stove to accept the drawer microwave.  Not a problem for me as I am a woodworker, but a problem or extra costs for others.  In addition, I had to add an electrical outlet.  Not a problem for me as I am a retired electrical engineer, but maybe a cost for others.  After the installation, simple enough, the drawer didn't want to stay closed.  That is, you push the close button and the drawer closed but re-opened immediately.  I was about to call for service but I did the following:  push the drawer closed manually, that is by hand.  This seemed to work and then the automatic closure mechanism started working okay.  So, no service call required.  The only shortcomings I see are that the power is not as great as our prior microwave and that there isn't a rotating table.  Dispite this, we are happy with this model so far after about a year.  Shorter people may like this oven a lot, and, it is REALLY COOL!  So, I would recommend this oven.",2012-02-26

We purchased one with the same length and width but after installing it realized the adjacent cabinet door wouldnt open since it  is at an angle due to the microwave sticking out too far from the wall. The standard size is 16'deep and up. Anything over 15' deep will stick out too far for the cabinet to open and the ONLY microwave available anywhere with 14.9' depth was this one. We desperately needed a new microwave so decided to give this same model, MCO160UW, a second try it failed again after 1 week of use. It will not run longer than 1 minute and 30 seconds at a time until it shuts off. In order to use it again you must wait a few minutes for it to turn back on. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.",2012-01-26

Soooo, today I called Whirlpool to discuss the problem...the first person that I spoke with offered me a contract for $285 that she said would cover the service call, all parts & labor, plus would give me warranty coverage for 1 year.  Since the service call was going to be $129, I accepted the $285 offer (which I had to accept within 24 hours or it would not be offered to me again).  After verifying at least 3 times that this would cover all expenses incurred, I gave her my credit card # and she transferred me to what was to be the service appointment scheduling extension; actually, it was the extended warranty department, who told me that this $285 contract did not cover handles, knobs, etc...one hour later (was I frustrated by this or what???) still on the phone, having been transferred at least 6 times (each person I spoke with had the same message...I apologize).  I didn't want any more apologies...I wanted action!!!  The only action I got after FINALLY speaking with a supervisor was that I could cancel the contract (as if I didn't know this much), but it would take a few days to have my credit card credited.  Oh, when I told one of the 6 people I spoke with during that hour that I Googled this problem and found that I was not the only one that experienced this, she told me that competitors post those comments on Amazon.com...grrrrr.  I need to replace a dishwasher, stove, & refrigerator...they won't be Whirlpool.",2012-01-13

Unfortunately it was the Firday before a holiday weeked and I was not able to contact Whrilpool until the following week. Whrilpool refused to honor the warranty when I called becasue it was two day expired.   A service repair man then came to the house to diagnose the problem. He told me the the microwave needed an new magnetron and control board. However, he said me that I should just get a different microwave. If I replaced the parts in this microwave he would probably be back in another year becuase Whrilpool had so many problems with this model. After that recommendation I looked at reviews on the Whrilpool web sight and Amazon, defective magnetrons seem to be a problem with this unit.   I would not recommend purchasing this unit since it seems that there is a problem with functionality and their warranty department is unwilling to budge on anything.",2012-01-05

It works great and it looks beautiful. I actually purchased mine online from walmart, but I order from amazon alot and wanted to put my review here for all of you. I've had mine almost 2 months now. It has a 3 prong grounding plug. It's 900 watts and heats things up a lot faster than my other microwave, so I'm still getting use to that. I'm going to try and address everything I see people asking questions about. First off, when you hit a number, for example 2, it will automatically start cooking 2 minutes. You can press the start button and add 30 seconds. If you want a specific time, for example 3 minutes and 45 seconds, you can press the power button, then the numbers, 3,4, and 5.  It will start cooking 3 min. 45 secs. It has a lot of buttons for specific items like popcorn, pizza, dinner plate, defrost, etc. It has a normal hum when running. It has a turntable. The clock is displayed in green. It beeps 5 times, not super loud but loud enough, then stops. The light comes on when you open the door and while cooking. It has an easy to use child safety lock to lock the door. I've not had any problems with fingerprints on the exterior.The handle pulls easily. It has a nice weight to it. I have mine on a cabinet with grip bottom shelving paper under it, so I don't know if it would slide on a smooth surface or not, mine doesn't.  The inside dimensions are 12 in. wide, 12 in. deep, and 8 in. high. The turntable plate is 10 1/2 in.  Plenty of room for most things you microwave. For the outside dimensions, the width (side to side) is 19 in., the height is 11 1/2 in. The outside dimensions given for depth includes the slight protrusion in back and the handle. The actual microwave is 13 in deep without the handle and protrusion in the back. Here's the best way to let you know the depth to know if it will fit on your shelf or wherever else you put it. I have my microwave sitting on a cabinet which is 1 in. from the wall. I have it sitting 1 1/2 in. from the back of the cabinet. The actual protrusion is about 1 in from the back of the cabinet. There are vents in the back (and on the side opposite the handle-left side if you're facing the microwave) plus the protrusion, so it needs some space. This means I have it 2 1/2 in. total from the wall. It comes out 15 in. from the back of my cabinet. The front legs sit back 2 1/2 in., which means that it is 12 1/2 in. from the back of my cabinet to the front legs. So, if your shelf is 12 1/2 in. deep, the legs would all fit on the shelf with the protrusion being 1 in. from the back of your shelf. I have the extra inch from the back of the cabinet to the wall, so if you don't, you might need your shelf to be at least 13 to 13 1/2 in. deep to give you more vent space. I think this covers everything. I think you'll be satisfied if you purchase this microwave.from the back of the cabinet. The actual protrusion is about 1 in from the back of the cabinet.
