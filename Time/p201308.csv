These things come completely apart in 5 larger pieces, it takes no time to clean and I know I didn't miss anything<br />- they are easy to re-assemble, just pop the silicon ring into the base, screw on the body (make sure the threads are right and its tight to prevent leaks) pop nipple into neck then screw onto top! I found these much more user friendly than other anti-colic bottles. Even my beloved Born Free that I used for my first son can't stand up to the MAM.<br />-did I mention they have helped the gas issue?  Because that's the most important part for me :)<br />-I like how much this set comes with for the low price, I should note the pacis are 2+ month so they may be a little big for newborns.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-they can leak, most of the time its user error,  note what I said early about watching the threads, I have done it a few times and accidentally dumped half the bottle on me and the baby, but once I figured out what I was doing wrong I've had no more leaks.  If you are super groggy at night, you may want to have some bottles already put together so you don't have to worry about it.<br />- I wouldn't heat liquid in them. My hubby has with no issues,  but I just don't trust it. Its easier for me to reheat the bottle that I pumped in and pour the liquid into these. Besides the wide bottom doesn't fit in some warmers.<br />-the numbers aren't the easiest to read especially if you care about anything less than 2 ounces.  For me, this hasn't been an issue to cause much concern.<br /><br />Overall I love the bottles, they are cute and more functional than I could hope! Amazon does seem to have the best price,  so I intend to purchase extras here",2013-07-15

We have not noticed the slightest bit of confusion, though we use this pacifier very intermittently.<br /><br />This pacifier is small & easy to stash in a diaper bag. The Soothie & Gum Drop pacifiers are much bigger! We usually leave one right in the seat of the carseat & the swing. The small handle is nice if you want to attach it to a ribbon & clip it onto your baby's clothes. We feel confident in these pacifiers because they are BPA free.<br /><br />We are fiercely determined not to use this pacifier at night, so I cannot comment on the benefits of the glow-in-the-dark feature.<br /><br />We alternate between these & the Soothie pacifier, though we usually have more success with these pacifiers.",2013-07-02

It was a larger Nuk that someone gave as a gift—at the time I had no idea there were sizes for these things. After a day or two, our daughter seemed to &#34;latch&#34; with this and I got a nice long nap. Since it seemed to work well for her, I decided to come here to Amazon and order a few (and discovered the Newborn and other size options).<br /><br />Because I had her on a larger one previously, these &#34;Newborn&#34; pacifiers were immediately useless, as she would seemingly not even notice there was something to suck on and it would fall out of her mouth. The larger one we had gotten as a gift has a cover than closes when it falls, but my wife doesn't like that because she thinks it will leave a mark. I don't even know the size, so I am going to experiment and order some more now. Hopefully we'll get the right one.<br /><br />If you've used standard latex feeding nipples, these may not work for your baby at all because they are too small.",2013-06-07

He became attached to the Soothie brand pacifier we were given at the hospital. When he was around 2 months, we began the battle of him losing his pacifier in the night and I was constantly waking up to put it back in his mouth. I had been skeptical about trying a Wubbanub because I was afraid he would form an attachment to it since it's a toy and a Soothie in one and that it would be hard to break him of it. In a state of sleep deprivation, I picked this one up and am so glad I did!<br /><br />When he was still small, I swaddled this up with him and night so that he didn't lose it. Did it make him sleep through the night? No. But at least I wasn't constantly retrieving a pacifier. As he got older, he learned to hold it himself and guide it back in his mouth. The longhorn attached made it easier for his immature eye-hand coordination than if it was just the pacifier. Now that he's 8 months old, he chews on the horns, sucks on the tag, and chews on the pacifier. I don't have bumper pads in his crib, so other pacifiers fall through the rail. This Wubbanub stays in the crib much better than those do.<br /><br />I've read reviews that say it's cheaply made or not easily washable and I do not agree. About once a week I round up all the pacifiers and boil them. I just hold the nipple of this into the boiling water to keep the longhorn dry. Rather than throwing it in the washing machine with clothes when the longhorn gets dirty (and it does a lot because it goes everywhere with us), I just hand wash it with some Dreft and let it air dry. This keep it from getting fuzzy, as other reviewers have mentioned.<br /><br />I had actually gotten on here to order a second one because we like it so much and I'm afraid we'll lose the one we have. My fear came true that this has become his lovey, but I plan to just cut the pacifier off when the time comesto wean off of it. I still wish he didn't use a pacifier, but I'm so happy that we found something he likes and is capable of using all on his own!<br /><br />UPDATED JULY 2013<br /><br />I still fully stand behind this product, but wanted to update that we did have our first big issue with this Wubbanub. At 10 months, my son is a terror when it comes to teething. He bites and chews very hard on anything available, including this pacifier. On the one he's been using for 6 months, he was finally able to rip the pacifier part off of the longhorn by chomping down on the pacifier and pulling on the plush part over and over for weeks. It came off in one piece and wasn't a choking hazard, but it's thoroughly confused my son! I think part of the problem is that these are made with Soothies for ages 0-6 months, which has thinner material in the pacifier. If I had a way to attach a 6+ month paci to this, it would probably fare much better. Still a great product, but keep an eye out for your little chompers and make sure that the material is still holding firm.",2013-05-14

She said the feet were weighted to hold the whole thing on the chest of the baby. It sounded perfect, especially for the car seat and when my little girl is laying on her back. Unfortunately, there are many things wrong with this product. First of all, the pacifier is permanently attached to the stuffed animal and can not be removed to be cleaned properly. The weighted feet have a few little bean bag beads in them which do not keep it still at all. As soon as my daughter moves even slightly, the thing pulls right out of her mouth. Even when she's asleep, She has to lay perfectly still to keep it in her mouth...as soon as she moves her head, it comes out and she wakes up. At least with a regular pacifier, when she lets go of it, it falls away from her face.

WubbaNub should win a prize, for most awesome baby product for PARENTS!  Why parents? Because you finally do not have to get up every 2 min to put the soothie back in after your baby spits it up!<br /><br />My baby played a game called stupid soothie and mommy, where she would suck the soothie until mommy got back in bed, waited 2 min for mommy to get comfy, and BAM, spit it out, or with the help of her tiny long fingers, hurl the soothie right out of the crib.  I swear I would get up at least 20 times with each time I put her in the crib.  I was growing so frustrated.  Then while reading some forum, I kept seeing references to Wubbanub, due to the odd name, I looked it up, and it was like a bright light had shined on me!  I was saved!  I ordered one immediately, and life has been a bliss ever since!  My baby would also go into crying spells in the car, when I drove and the soothie fell out, and I had no way of getting it back into babies mouth asap.  The Wubbanub has stopped all of this drama.  The bear design in particular works better than some others, the month of the bear is bigger and holds the soothie down and in the mouth.  We also have the giraffe, and while cute, the mouth of giraffe where soothie is connected is thin and longer, and the soothie doesn't stay in quite as well as with the bear.<br /><br />Additional tip: if you put a blanket on top of the bear, it stays in even better, less risk of slipping out.  Also, after the initial wash/soothie boil, instead of boiling everyday and getting half the bear wet, I bought pacifier wipes that work well to get all the grime/germs off.<br /><br />This has seriously been a life saver!",2013-04-21

Having a video feed, in addition to the audio, is wonderful.  This monitor does an adequate job of displaying a good angle of the room and is pretty clear even in the near dark.  In my opinion, the video doesn't have to be high definition, but simply good enough to give an idea of what your kid is doing.  This monitor does the job, and does it well.<br /><br />2. After about 11 months of use, the monitor would not take a charge.  Playing around with it, I determined that the wall charger was fine, but the battery would not recharge, or continue to work even when plugged in.  Even though we may have been out of warranty (we received the monitor as a gift well before the twins arrived), I called Motorola and they agreed to replace the monitor for free.  Much more than I expected from customer service.  So although it failed, Motorola was responsive and took care of the problem.  Since then, we haven't had any problems.<br /><br />3. The user interface isn't perfect.  For example, we have twins and purchased an extra camera for a second room.  While we love the ability to add extra cameras, and the possibility of setting the monitor to automatically cycle through the cameras, for some reason you cannot change the video feed while the volume or brightness control is on the display.  And there is a huge lag in the time it takes for the volume control to clear the screen after you hit the button.  Often, we'll hear one kid crying, pick up the monitor and turn up the sound, and then have to wait several seconds for that to clear before changing to a different video feed.  While this may seem like user error, or a small inconvenience, I'll be the first to admit that we aren't always thinking clearly at 2 a.m., which also happens to be the time when I have the least patience for the volume control to clear so I can change feeds.  This isn't a deal breaker, but it keeps me from giving it five stars.<br /><br />4.  It has additional features, like the ability to play music and speak through a microphone to the camera.  I've never used these other than to make my wife jump when she is putting away the kids' laundry.  It doesn't detract from the product, but seems unnecessary to me.<br /><br />Overall, this seems like the best monitor for the price.  Although I won't say it's perfect, I am happy we chose the MBP33 and have no regrets.'t a deal breaker, but it keeps me from giving it five stars.<br /><br />4.

The only con I would say is that it can not be clipped to a paci holder... although I did here they are now making some of them to fit.",2013-04-15

We have multiples, and once your baby loves them you'll be buying multiples too! We have used these since leaving the hospital, and therefore avoided baby waking up in the middle of the night due to losing her pacifier. They stay in because the stuffed animal helps them stay close to their mouth instead of falling out as soon as they stop sucking. As they get older, the stuffed animal serves as a comfort toy, full of texture and appendages to pull. Sometimes baby sucks and chews on everything but the pacifier! They also are easy to wash. We wash the pacifier in the sink, keeping the plush out of the water for quick cleans. Then, when a deep clean is needed (after all that chewing) we wash the whole thing in a delicate laundry bag in the washing machine with her baby clothes. This is why I recommend more than one, so you can wash one and have a back up for baby. The elephant was great due to the big ears, she loves to pull on those. We constantly have other parents asking about this pacifier....once you have one you'll be a believer.",2013-04-14

We bought small packs of three different types of pacifiers to see what our baby would prefer.  We bought Dr Brown's Prevent, Nuk, and Avent.  Our baby will LOVES the Dr Brown pacifiers.  She'll put up with the Avent ones, but they pop out of her mouth so easily it's hardly worth it.  The Nuk ones get spit out almost instantly, they're too hard to keep in her mouth.  These ones have a fantastic shape that is very well designed.  I love that it doesn't give her gas because she's not sucking any air.  These are just so perfectly designed and we've already bought more for her.  I think it's good advice to try different pacifiers for your baby because all babies are different, but I will say that these ones definitely stay in their mouths better no matter who your baby is - so I won't tell you not to try different pacifiers at first, but definitely include these when you're trying a few out!  They'll probably become a quick favorite for you and baby.<br /><br />Originally we purchased the Dr Browns Prevent pacifiers from another Amazon listing where Colors may vary and there are no handles on the pacifier.  We ended up with blue and red, which I didn't love for our little girl.  It's silly and not important, but I didn't love having her suck on a blue or red pacifier when she was always dressed in pink or purple.  These pacifiers are much preferred!  Though they're the same shape for sucking, there are a few differences.  The silly difference (but it matters to me!) of the color is the obvious difference.  Another key difference is these ones also have the handles on them and the others don't.  I have found that I much prefer the handles for multiple reasons.  One, they are easy to hold if I'm burping her and just want to have the pacifier handy for when she's done and ready for it.  Two, if I drop the pacifier, the extra weight from the handle makes it land on the back almost every time so the nipple doesn't get dirty.  Three, if you're attaching a pacifier clip, it can attach to the handle instead of the opening on the part of the pacifier that touches the baby's face.  Our pacifier clip was always rubbing against our baby's face when using the other ones and I didn't like that since it left a red mark on her cheek.<br />Another difference is that these pacifiers actually come with a clip-on nipple cover.  I LOVE this accessory because if I'm running to a neighbor's house for a short visit and I don't need to tote a whole diaper bag, but I do want to bring a pacifier - I easily can with the clip cover.  It works so great to just clip the cover on so I can throw the pacifier in my pocket without it getting all nasty.  Or it's nice for putting in the diaper bag without getting gross as well.<br /><br />The price is about the same (within a dollar) of the other colors may vary listing, so these ones are the clear winner between the two listings.  If you want a great pacifier for your little girl, these are PERFECT!",2013-04-09

And I love how many models you can choose from! It is such a good idea to combine a pacifier with a plush toy. So cute, and so convenient to take in the car, or to give baby at night. I agree with people who say that the pacifier doesn't stay long in their kid's mouth: my baby, too, pulls the pacifier out of her mouth because she keeps grasping and playing with the giraffe. But that's ok with me, as long as she is having fun with it.<br /><br />However, I have to complain about the poor quality of this item:<br />- I saw someone writing that the plush looked like a happy meal toy. Yes, it does, indeed! It is soft enough for my baby to enjoy, but I still feel that for the price it could be somewhat nicer.<br />- The pacifier is not the best. The shape is actually pretty bad. The base of it shouldn't be round and have a 'cut-out' for the nose, like most other pacifiers do.<br />- I HATE that the plush doesn't detach, it makes it so much more difficult to wash. I would actually have liked it if you could detach the plush to wash it, and why not re-attach it to any pacifier, so that you could change the color of the pacifier, upgrade for a 6+ month pacifier, replace it when it is damaged, etc. I get that they don't want you to buy another brand of pacifier, but couldn't they at least make a system where you can remove and attach to this brand of pacifiers, and sell separate pacifiers and plush toys? Kind of a 'mix-n-match' concept? That would be sooooo great!<br /><br />Would these points be solved (and they are easily solved), it would be one of the best items on the market for a young baby. I also bought one for my godson and he loves his so much, too, but his mom has the exact same issues than I do. Anyhow, I don't regret my purchase but hope that Wubbanub will make this product better before I have another baby...",2013-03-23

(the one that comes with it no longer works for us as when in place it pulls my daughters long legs tight against the stroller which obviously she hates.)  this xl stroller has a longer than average  stroller canopy so i have found most generic weather shields are too short over the top resulting in the shield looking odd (as the corners aren't on the corners at all but up an inch on to the roof of the stroller hood) & consequently losing inches in length of coverage for the front.  (jeep standard stroller weather shield does just this and is also very flimsy.  ripped at one joint first time i put it on!) this shield just about works.  i have found that if you attach from the second set of velcro fastenings down it will do a passable job of fitting.  it has a longer front than any other i have tried and finishes only  2-3 inches away from the foot support. it also seems quite sturdy, unlike the jeep cover it doesn't feel like it will rip at the seams. i have no doubts it will flap around a bit in the wind (although it is anchored well around the back of the stroller with decent velcro fastenings) but as i'm more concerned about rain this is fine for me.  all in all i think this is a good shield for the price.",2013-03-07

I have the sheep one and it blends into everything. But for some reason the pacifier sits weird with this one, I think it's the beak. It kind of makes it less flexible with the position you have it in. The sheep could be in any position and it'll stay in his mouth. Not with this one. But my 4 month old loves the bright colors of it. He has also started playing with the duck and the sheep now that he's getting older and discovering textures more and more. Like my review of the sheep I would say besides the odd positioning of the pacifier due to the beak, my only other grievance is that the pacifiers aren't removable. You have to wash the whole thing together. And if the pacifier is broken or anything you need to buy a whole new one... kind of aggravating. But I will continue to buy them.",2013-03-04

I chose Binkibear because I liked the idea of the detachable pacifier. As it turned out, I made a good choice because my grandson has never really cared much for pacifiers. He's 4-1/2 months now and he prefers chewing to sucking most of the time. This bear is at least twice as big as the other animals that have the attached pacifiers, making it the perfect size for an actual stuffed toy. He will pick it up off his play mat and hug it and chew on its arms or legs. Maybe when he has a bit more dexterity he'll put the pacifier in his mouth now and then. For now it is a cute, safe toy. He has other toys made for teething (He's not teething yet) but he prefers to chew on this bear and on the leg of a small stuffed cow I gave him.",2013-03-03

Also, #2 sucks on the pacifier then turns her head and goes to sleep - I feel like the fact that the pacifier is so near she can use it when needed but then spit it out and fall asleep.<br /><br />The actual product was smaller and more lightweight than I anticipated, but I do love this product.  I only leave it at home, and take different pacifiers out of the house.",2013-02-22

These are wipes that you can use to clean pacifiers, sippy cups, bottle nipples, teethers, or whatever if they happen to fall on the ground (or get thrown...) and you are nowhere near a source of water or soap and can rinse things. They come in a convenient little package, they are disposable, and fit into a diaper bag along with the several other different types of wipes a mom must carry around with her.<br /><br />I purchased these initially from Amazon once, because I had never seen them in stores. Immediately after receiving them in the mail I noticed them in stores, for a significantly lower price than what I had paid. So I stopped buying them on here. I also now prefer [[ASIN:B004HM368U Munchkin 36 Pack Arm and Hammer Pacifier Wipes, White]] instead of the First Years ones.<br /><br />First of all, these are indeed wonderful for when you are not near soap and water and can't rinse things off. But for most people, that is not really often enough to justify the purchase of the wipes or having to carry them around with everything else crammed into a diaper bag. In most situations where I couldn't rinse off something in a sink I didn't have these wipes, I usually had a bottle of water I could pour over the item to rinse it. That's not to say that these aren't useful if maybe you are on a long road trip with few rest areas where you can buy water or rinse things in a bathroom sink, or if you are camping, or if your baby is screaming in the middle of the store and you need to sanitize her pacifier quickly and don't have time to dash to the restroom to use the soap and water. In such cases, these are very useful. But its not an everyday occurrence and something to think about before stocking up on multiple packs.<br /><br />There is the issue with the chemicals and the possible residue. That is why I like the Munchkin brand better now, because these left a sort of oily feeling residue and the Munchkin ones left none. But I do prefer an oily residue over possible bacteria or fungus that might have otherwise been on the item. They have an odd scent which I think is some sort of sugary flavor left on the cup or toy or whatever so the baby doesn't taste the cleaning chemicals. I'm not sure if that bothers me or not, as it is probably a necessary evil. Unfortunately it seems that my daughter didn't like the taste because after using the wipes she never wanted her pacifier, and made a disgusted face when pulling it out of her mouth. She stopped using her pacifier at 3 months. So maybe use these to wipe your pacis down when you are trying to wean your child off them.<br /><br />All things considered, these are pretty good for situations when there is no soap and water, but these are definitely not a replacement for soap and water.an oily residue over possible bacteria or fungus that might have otherwise been on the item.

I decided to give this one a try, hoping that maybe if the paci fell out, it would still stay close enough for her to get back in her mouth on her own.  No such luck.  Also, when she starts vigorously sucking, she gets all excited and starts to pull on the animal, causing the paci to come out.  My sister had one of these with her DS a couple years ago, but I remember the animal being a little more weighted than this pink bear... per another reviewer, perhaps the quality has changed a bit over the years?<br /><br />The nice things about this paci is that it's cute as heck.  Also, when the paci does fall out of her mouth, it doesn't go too far - a problem I had with the paci alone falling on the floor and then me needing a few backups on hand in case I couldn't wash it right away.  I think this would be great for on the go - less likely for this bigger thing to fall out of the carseat (I don't think I quite trust a paci leash with my DD being this little).<br /><br />The one thing I don't like about this is that you can't remove the paci from the animal, so it makes washing a little tricky.  I'm used to having to sterilize everything daily for a preemie and this one you can't really throw in the dishwasher or in the steam basket.  The only way to sterilize is to dip it in boiling water and trying not to get the animal wet.  Based on reviews, doesn't sound like a good idea to throw this guy in the washing machine.  Plus, I'm not sure if I would want my DD's paci in the washing machine anyways.<br /><br />I am hoping as she gets a little bigger and if we decide to stick with a paci, that this will work out better for us.

When I saw this cute little puppy that has the pacifier attached, I couldn't help but purchase it for my friend's coming up baby shower.  The pacifier, as I stated before, is the best!  And the attached puppy makes it so easy to keep track of!  The puppy is soft and cuddly, and perfect for boy or girl!<br /><br />The reason I gave it  4 stars instead of 5 is solely because, I've seen other versions of this product, and usually the stuffed animal is a little bigger.

I had previously used the AVENT Orthodontic Infant Pacifier for 0-6 months. The (0-6 months) pacifiers had symmetrical nipples as well as mouth guards, so no right side up or upside down. As my baby grew and it seemed as if he was almost able to swallow the whole pacifier I knew it was time to get a larger size. So because he had been using the Avent ones with no difficulty I purchased, what looked like, the same product but in a larger size. But that wasn't exactly the case. The NIPPLE was symmetrical but the mouth guard was not. It wasn't a huge deal really, I didn't return the products. We purchased both the clear and clear with blue center. The blue colored ones were easier to find, especially at night.<br />I will say that we are lucky that our baby decided he didn't want/need to use pacifiers at 8.5 months on his own.<br />These were very useful for us while we needed them.

After a couple of duds, we found this.  It's great! My daughter is 18 months and still uses the small rounded size.<br /><br />First and foremost, it had to be safe.  And this is, in many different ways.  Made from natural rubber and oils, I am not concerned about contaminating plastics.  The shape is awesome; it cleans up easily and has no cracks for bacteria to hide when cleaning and sterilizing.  When it first comes out of the box, it is oily.  As others have mentioned, after you wash for the first time, instructions say to boil for a few minutes.  Let it cool and you'll see the oils have been tamed.<br /><br />My daughter loves this paci.  We once ran out of them after I noticed a crack on the side of the nipple (my fault - I let it go much longer than the recommended 6 weeks between replacement).  That was a very long a night.  I tried a few chemical laden replacements until I could get a new shipment in to no avail.<br /><br />All that being said, these are expensive.  And the cost doubles when you realize that you are supposed to replace them every 6 weeks or so.  Much longer than that and the pacifiers start to harden.  But for all the benefits, I will continue to use these and have some peace of mind knowing I am using the safest product.",2013-01-29

He may have never liked pacifiers and he may never will. My 3 year old will not ween off his pacifier but my youngest does not do them.  Your child may not like this product, and judging by the other reviews, it may not be the Plush Toy Pacifier, it just might be your kid.<br /><br />Let me just say that this is the worse pacifier ever. If I could use profanity to describe this frustrating little plush toy pacifier, this review would be nothing but four letter words mixed with a couple conjunctions  and verbs and tons of profane adjectives, but since we are all parents or know someone who is, I will keep it clean.<br /><br />This pacifier does not stay in the infants mouth, the plush toy is actually a hinderance to keeping it in an infants mouth, and because of this, this pacifier is useless. The actual rubber part is very anatomically close to an actual human nipple, so to the infant, no other pacifier will do. So now you are ...lets just say you are in a very difficult position because you are forced to hold the pacifier in place , so whats the use. Our infant son is 5 weeks old and extremely fussy during his bewitching hour, a pacifier that stays in place would be so useful at this time, but instead, we are force to deal with a very unhappy child between 7 and 11pm. Maybe this is a great product when the infant is older, but by 3 months, a baby can manipulate is own pacifier, so again this product is useless.<br /><br />If you are a parent to be, please do not put this on your registry. If you are a friend or family of a new parent please do not give this as a gift. If you are the creator of this product , I hope karma comes back and makes you pay for what you have done to parents of newborns.",2013-01-26

She bit holes it years ago, as her teeth were coming in.  I snipped off the rest down to the base, and that was the end of pacifiers for her.  But it wasn't the end of the kitty...<br /><br />In the beginning, WubbaNub pacifiers were a LIFE-SAVER for us!  Our younger daughter was born with a horrific case of reflux.  It was strongly suggested by many professionals that she use a pacifier to help keep the acid from bothering her too much.  But what a pain it was to keep popping it back in ever few minutes, especially during the night (not that she was sleeping all that much--again, due to the reflux).  Duct tape was jokingly considered.<br /><br />An internet search eventually lead me to the WubbaNub website, and I found a local dealer to buy from (they weren't on Amazon back then).  She was 3 months old when she got her first kitty, and a back-up kitty followed several months later.  The rest is history.<br /><br />When she was a baby, it worked fantastically!  It wasn't too long before she learned to push the pacifier back into her own mouth and save me the trouble.  It was a little lighter weight than I had expected, but it still worked wonderfully.<br /><br />When we bought it, we had NO idea that we were getting her a friend for life.  And what a life it's had!  As of today, the nipple is gone (only a green ring remains), the rear left leg has no more stuffing in it and is pretty thoroughly mangled (she likes to rub it between her fingers as she falls asleep), the coloring has faded a bit, and I just noticed that the stitching along the spine is starting to show slightly.  But after all these years, and all the LOVE it's received, I'm not surprised by the wear-and-tear.  Honestly, I'm a little shocked it's held up so well.<br /><br />To say this is her favorite lovie/toy would be putting it lightly.  Some day, she may choose to put it on the shelf and be done with it, but that day isn't any time soon.  :)",2013-01-10

It fits very nicely, with no gaps, but I was a little put off by the material.  We have a firm crib mattress from Da Vinci at home, and this mattress seemed much more firm.  It's also covered in plastic, not fabric; although it's nice not to need a waterproof mattress pad, it winds up being very noisy if your baby moves, rustling the sheet against the plastic.  I would have preferred a fabric cover, and either buying a waterproof pad myself if I was using the mattress a lot, or just forgoing it and risking ruining the mattress, since it's fairly inexpensive and we were only using it for a short time.<br /><br />I know these aren't huge issues, but the bottom line is that my baby did not sleep well on it, and since we were in the same room, neither did we.  She adjusted quickly to the new surroundings and napped just fine in her usual Rock 'n Play, so I don't think it was just the fact that we were traveling.

She loved it. It is machine washable and as soon as you take it out, it does not really need to be dried as it is dried already and is ready to be used.<br />I thought it was a bigger giraffe and was disappointed at first to see it so tiny, but I believe it is the appropriate size for an infant not to choke on. It is a pricey ($13-$14 ea.). Wish it was half price, and wish I could replace pacifiers on the stuffed animal, but can not, since it is sewed with stitches to the giraffe.<br /><br />BabyHaven is really professional and nice. When I received other regular Soothie pacifiers in damaged boxes, they offered to send me replacements for free. Hoping to receive them soon by mail.<br />----------------------------------------<br />Edited April 8, 2013:<br />I now have an Amazon Prime Membership with my Amazon Mom membership, I receive everything in 2 days and can return items with no hassle. Back when I bought the Wubbanub and Avent Soothie Pacifiers from BabyHaven, I thought they proposed to send me free pacifiers to replace the damaged packages I received but they did not and wanted me to pay for the return shipping rate. They said since product is not damage it is my responsibility. They tucked 6 Avent soothie pacifiers and 3 wubbanub pacifiers in one small bubbly envelop!!! The Avent Soothie's package was ruined but they did not care.<br />They were not so professional what so ever.<br /><br />We are treated better when we get the Prime Membership as we deal with Amazon directly versus with the seller. Packaging is better, as they send in a boxes even small ones versus in an envelop that gets ur package damaged from shipping.<br /><br />Would still recommend the product though. My daughter stopped taking the pacifier around 4 months, but she loves to play with the tiny stuffed animal and chew on it sometimes :) So cute!",2012-12-21

My baby didn't like it much at first, either. Then, we re-introduced it around 5 months and he LOVED it and stopped using any of his other pacifiers. I think maybe the fact that he was more mobile- able to roll over and almost crawling and so it was easier for him to find it in the crib. I truly believe that this item was what got him to start sleeping through the night because SO many of the night wakes were just that he lost his pacifier.<br /><br />What a previous reviewer had complained about (how the whole thing has to go in the wash) I think is one of the best features. When it's dirty, you just throw the whole thing in the wash and it dries (I just hang it up rather than put in the dryer) within a couple hours.<br /><br />I do suggest having three in rotation. Our daycare already lost one. If we didn't have a back-up, it could have been bad. Oh- and don't pay more than $15. Occasionally, these items (the different animals) will be out of stock and other sellers through Amazon will have some for sale for $30+.

I had purchased EVERY SINGLE brand and style of pacifier.  My daughter refused them all except the soothies. The Wubbanub is a Soothie pacifier with an animal attached. I saw a friend with a Wubbanubs so I ordered one to try. It's been a life saver!! At 6wks old she clings to the animal. The weight of the animal helps the pacifier stay in her mouth especially when she's laying on her back or in the car seat. A tip when using the a soothie style pacifier,  put a finger in the whole while she's sucking on it, they like the way it feels.  We have the monkey, giraffe and duck. The giraffe is her favorite. Not sure why its more expensive though. And, babies r us carries these for only $10.95<br /><br />Regarding cleaning, there are 3 ways to clean/sterilize them.<br />1. Boil : Put a ziplock bag around animal, dip pacifier part in a bowl boiling water and let soak for 5-10 mins. This sterlizes It. At the end of each day  I take a a paper towel with soap and hot water and wash the pacifier part.<br />2. Dishwasher : I used the bottle basket and put on top shelf of dishwasher. Then let air dry.

 i would give them 6 or 7 stars.<br /><br />they combine all of the good features of the other brands into one product, with none of the flaws that the other products have.<br /><br />i love these bags!<br /><br />okay, so here's the low down on these:<br /><br />- this is the new version of honeysuckle's breastmilk bags, which are designed to be used with a pump--you just pump right into them.<br /><br />the bags have little holes on the top part, so that you can attach them to a pump adapter.  so, for the full experience, you need a pump adapter or two, which you can get by purchasing a pack of bags made by your pump's manufacturer.  i bought these medela bags: [[asin:b007pexokw medela pump & save breastmilk bags with easy-connect adapter - 50 ct]] because i have a medela pump.  i don't know if adapters are interchangeable between brands.  then, use the medela bags if you want, so that you're not wasting, and so that you know how wonderful these honeysuckle bags are when you start using them.  whether or not you use the bags, keep the little plastic adapters.<br /><br />then get some of these honeysuckle breast pump bags, and you'll see how perfect they are.<br /><br />medela vs. honeysuckle<br />all right, so here are the reasons that i like this bag better than the medela bags:<br />1. the plastic is not as rigid as the medela bags, yet it is still thick enough that you don't have to worry about it.<br />2. get this: the honeysuckle bags fit the medela easy adapter better than the medela bags do!  with the medela bags, you have to put them on at just the right angle, and it's kind of a tight fit.  then removing the bags after you've pumped is...well, interesting.  the honeysuckle bags are easy to put on, and they still stay put while you're pumping, but then they are easy to remove when you're done.<br />3. the honeysuckle bags can be stored flat in the freezer so that it is easier to store more, instead of having a bunch of squatty bags like the medela ones.  or, you can store them upright if you prefer.  another nice thing about storing them flat is that they defrost more quickly when you're ready to use them.<br />4. the honeysuckle bags can fit more milk.  they are marked to 6 oz (medela is marked to 5 oz), but since they can be stored flat, there is also just a bunch of extra space.  so, if you fill a little more it doesn't create any problem.  the medela bags get kind of messy if you put any more than 5 oz.<br />5. the honeysuckle bags have two seals.  medela only has one, and it doesn't always seal perfectly.<br />6. the honeysuckle bags are much, much less expensive than medela bags: right now (based on the cost of packs of 50 bags on amazon) honeysuckle bags are about 23 cents each and medela bags are 40 cents each.  so, medela bags are almost double the cost of honeysuckle bags.<br /><br />those are the things that come to mind.<br /><br />lansinoh vs. honeysuckle<br />1. the lansinoh bags cannot attach to a pump directly.  so, you either have to pump into something else first or hold the bag the whole time you pump.<br />2. the seams on the lansinoh bags are thin--honeysuckle's seams are very thick, so you really don't have to worry about them splitting at all.<br />3. lansinoh bags are meant to be stored flat, which is great, but they are awkward to try to stand up (when you're filling them or actually using them). honeysuckle bags can also be stored flat, but they have a special bottom of the bag that makes it so that it can stand up well too.<br />4. lansinoh bags are partially sealed at the top, which is supposed to reassure us that the bags are sterile.  honeysuckle bags are completely sealed at the top, which is much more reassuring.<br />5. the label area on lansinoh bags is upside down (so that they are right-side up while in the freezer, maybe?).  regular honeysuckle bags have the writing right-side up, which i think is nice---but! these pump bags have no writing, so you can do your own thing, and if you want to put it right-side up or upside down, either will work.<br />6. lansinoh bags are considered the cheap brand; right now on amazon each bag works out to about 21 cents.  at only 23 cents each right now, honeysuckle bags are very comparable in price, while the quality is far superior.<br /><br />i am aware that there are a few other brands of bags out there, but i haven't tried them.  i started with medela bags, switched to lansinoh but didn't even finish the package of those, switched back to medela, started buying non-pump honeysuckle bags--which are also very good, and just heard about these.  i won't be switching brands again, because i can't think of anything i would want to be different.<br /><br />if you're considering these bags, i definitely recommend that you buy them.  you won't regret it.  the only thing that is kind of a pain about them is that they are not available in any stores near me, so i have to get them online.  that just means i have to plan ahead a little, but i can handle that.  every time i order bags from honeysuckle (this was my third order), i have received them within a few days, so shipping time is also minimal.ice---but!

(so nice to not have to get out of bed to check on her.) also, we plan to get a second camera and put that in the play room once she is older so we can check on her while doing other things.<br /><br />most video monitors cost a lot, and if you want tons of bells and whistles then you will have to shell out a lot of cash, but this one seemed to be the best for the price(especially based on all of the positive reviews). below are the positives and negatives i have found after 6 months of use. (plus a few \\eh, it doesn't do much for me\\ things.)<br /><br />positives<br />over 6 months of use and no problems at all!<br />can clearly hear and see our child (screen size is great, good detail during the day and very good night vision)<br />was about to mount the camera on the wall near the crib and see the entire inside of the crib while also being able to see a lot of details of her face.<br />displays the room temperature<br />decent range (can work outside and still hear and see her)<br />the sound is very clear and i like the five led alerts for noise level.<br /><br />eh, it doesn't do much for me<br />can zoom in one level (with how much a child moves in a crib it's not that helpful)<br />has an intercom so you can talk to your child (just made mine mad because she couldn't see me...will be a more useful feature when i buy a second camera and mount it in the play area)<br />has lullabies....kinda annoying to me, kid might like them.<br /><br />negatives<br />the only negative i have (and it's not that negative) is that the battery doesn't last super long. if you are smart and plug it in when it is not in use then you shouldn't have a problem. it does last for several hours left on and even longer if you turn it off but don't plug it in. i suggest you leave it plugged in at night and just leave the screen off. (the screen stays on when plugged in and will turn off after about 4 or 5 minutes if it's not.)<br /><br />overall.....a great buy!!!turn it off but don't plug it in. i suggest you leave it plugged in at night and just leave the screen off.

(maybe not only as a baby monitor). lastly, it had the vox feature that i didn't know too much about but it got me interested. it said something about noise cancellation and i wondered how that would work. lastly, i was very excited about the ptz feature on the cameras.<br /><br />as for design, i believe samsung's monitor looks sleek and elegant. the black on white really makes the monitor look like a quality product. the overall design of the camera, the color, and shape of the monitor is sharp, and the four way directional button to control the camera is very convenient and easy to use.<br />why i decided to go with samsung: i purchased the sew-3037 because of three reasons.  as a company, i trust samsung. they know how to make electronic products. i love their tv and i love their phones. i figured, they'd do a great job on this as well. secondly, the overall image quality, the ptz feature, and the vox feature. lastly, the monitor being expandable to four camera system.<br /><br />after receiving the monitor: i love it. i tested it for a couple of days and i can't stop playing with it. the overall video and audio quality on the camera is very good. the range hasn't given us any problems and we have a pretty sizeable house. i don't believe it's available now, but i definitely plan to purchase more cameras. the vox is a great feature. it saves battery so you get a good couple of hours on the monitor. it also keeps things quietly and goes into sleepmode when my daughter isn't making any noise for a minute or two. then it comes alive again if she stirs. you can set the sensitivity and also turn it off all together.<br /><br />the feel of the cameras and the monitor is solid, not flimsy at all. the color and design is as i thought, very sleek. i love the look of the camera. i'm thinking i'm going to find other uses for it even after my daughter gets older. i think this was a great buy and definitely will recommend it to my friends.",2012-11-17

WubbaNub (or Wubs, as he's called at our house) is a great friend and comfort for our baby. Why? Major pros:<br /><br />* Easy to grip: The feet are just big enough and round enough that she can get a solid grasp on any of them, and sometimes two at a time.<br />* Easy to hold: The little, soft body, which is filled with something slightly softer than beans, is easy for the baby to wrap an arm around, and light enough that she can lift and spin the giraffe with one determined fist.<br />* Easy for chewing: Not only are the feet satisfying for snacking, the little horns at the face make for interesting small chewy pieces against hier gums.<br />* High quality silicone pacifier: The Soothie pacifier that's attached is great, not just for the usual Soothie benefits but also because it's very sturdily attached to the giraffe's body. It can safely travel the washer and then be rinsed in hot water itself for maximum cleanliness.<br /><br />Points for debate:<br />* Doesn't always stay in her mouth longer. Yep, true -- sometimes she tugs it out. But she also seems less likely to have the whole thing drop from her grasp and fall to the floor; Wubs hits the deck much less often than the other, solo Soothies we have around the house.<br />* Longevity: We've had this in heavy rotation (daily play time probably equal to two hours) for a month, and he's showing a bit of wear. I imagine we'll need to restock with a second or third-string Wubbanub within the next three months if his popularity remains strong.",2012-11-17

I realized that the reason she did not take to the new one at first was because it did not smell familar to her.Now she loves it as much as her monkey and I can wash the other one finally...as she will not do without one :) It is PERFECT in every way,it's a pacifier and her lovey/security,she will only take the pacifier when she's sleepy but she will grasp the legs and hold on tight and cuddle with it.BEST OF ALL: I don't have to dig for a paci EVER!It is so easy to find any time any where.She has a hard time holding one in her mouth(preemie) and this helps her to keep it there and when she does not want it she can just move her head and it falls out/away but stays with her.These are very durable.One of my baby shower gifts from now on.<br />Suggestion on washing:I take a mesh bag(zipped) or pillowcase(tied at the end) and drop the Wubbanub in and throw it in the washing machine on gentle cycle,let it air dry then wash the pacifier with warm/hot soapy water or use a pacifier wipe and we are good to go.<br />I HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS ITEM OR ANY WUBBANUB :)",2012-11-09

The nipple is more similar to a breast, and to a baby who is exclusively breastfed, I would imagine that it is more soothing.

She is just barely coordinated to get her paci back in about 1/3 of the time (that I see, although she probably finds it sometimes and I don't even know).  Since she has figured out how to roll over, she only sleeps on her belly.  Mam pacifiers are great for belly sleepers because they have a low profile and don't get knocked out of baby's mouth when she turns her head, and they are super light so they stay in easily.  I have sprinkled like 6 pacis around her head at night to increase the odds that she'll find one.  Until now, she had been using the under six month size, but I wanted to get the 6+ size to see what the difference is.  The shield is a bit larger and so is the nipple, and the nipple is more bulbous at the end.  I haven't noticed that she has an easier or harder time keeping them in than the smaller size.  She seems to not care which size I give her.  The glowing is genius.  Only the knob glows, not the shield or nipple, so the glowing part doesn't touch her face.  Makes it a snap for me to find in the night, and I'm hopeful that it helps her find them more often, too!  I held them under the light for like 10 seconds before I put her down, and they were much dimmer but still glowing 12 hours later.",2012-10-13

I had a diva on my hands and she wanted nothing less than the real thing.  I finally discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. Finally we were saved!<br /><br />During my search for the holy grail of pacifiers, I came across these wubanubs and bought them mostly because they were super cute.  And since I was starting a collection of pacifiers, I figured it wouldn't hurt to try.  Love, love, love these.  And my daughter does as well.<br /><br />First let me begin by saying that the pacifier, on these precious dolls, are practically identical to the make and material of the hospital variety and perfect for my little one.  They are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night.  My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth.  I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown.  I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier.<br /><br />Although, they are a little pricier than a traditional pacifier...you save money by not having to purchase another two pack because you don't know where the gazillion others you purchased went.  I have yet to lose even one of these.  They also make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It appears to be a somewhat  meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib.  So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills and actually pacify.<br />There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The [[ASIN:B0028H3ACS WubbaNub Tabby Kitten]] is my favorite.  I have noticed that this one along with the Tabby cat is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush; however, I have cut the pacifier out of just one after its seen some wear.  ( Just as a caution.)  Once you stitch the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with, unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket.  I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.<br /><br />Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free.",2012-08-30

That adds up, and you can count it in whatever sanity is measured by.  The monkey is cute and soft, but very durable.  Whenever he gets grungy, he just goes in the wash with normal clothing.

It is ideal for breastfed babies. That is why it is one of the top pacifiers recommended by docs and hospitals.<br /><br />Even though my baby and I love this pacifier (it is the only one that we use) and I highliy recommend it, I do want think it is important to highlight some of the shortcomings/warnings that people should know about. But even with these problems, it is still the best option out there.<br /><br />Things you should know (but the pacifier is still worth it):<br />1) hard to hold: the little tiny tab on the back is really hard for a parent to find and hold. I have dropped this pacifier many times when trying to hold the little tab.<br />2) it is hard to clip: It is hard to find something to clip and keep this pacifier tied to baby. But that is the point. It is not recommended to stap the pacifier to baby because it is yet another item they can choke themselves with.<br />3) hard for baby to hold control: until baby is a bit older (3-6 months) and has better control of his/her hand, this pacifier is not easy for baby to hold and/or push back into the mouth. Other pacifiers have large handles or areas for small and uncontrolled hands to reach for and grab. Not this one.<br />4) CAUTION ABOUT SIZES: this is really important, and I only discovered this recently. There are two sizes (newborn 0-3 months) and (3+months). THe first size is much softer, the second size harder. It is important to change your baby to the larger size when they reach 3+ months because they start being able to bend the whole pacifier in the mouth and can even accidentally make the whole thing bend and fit in mouth! Super scary and dangerous. Though there are two small holes on either side of the pacifier that should allow baby to keep breathing if this were to happen, that gives me little comfort. The 3+ month size is much firmer and will prevent baby for bending and shoving the whole thing in mouth. So make sure you move to the second size!<br />* (theyhave also changed the way they package and label the sizes, to make everything more confusing! Before it was a newborn 0-3 month size, and then a 3/6month -18month size. Now the second size is simply labeled as 3+ months. Still the same pacifier, just new packaging to make sleep-deprived moms feel even more crazy....)",2012-08-23

As far as construction quality goes, it feels plenty sturdy. I can see no reason why it wouldn't hold up to regular use with no problem, provided you don't throw a tantrum and throw it against a wall, in which case you'll probably be needing the pacifiers for yourself instead of for baby.

The item itself seems terribly flimsy, and just has a cheap feel, much cheaper than I would expect from a product that's more expensive than a lot of competing products. Maybe it's composed of a tough, lightweight plastic, but if something looks cheap and feels cheap, well, let's just say it doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in a product.<br /><br />The next concern is battery life, which is rather poor. I guess those UV rays must take a lot of juice, because a fresh set of batteries doesn't last very long. That leads in to wondering just how well this thing works, especially when the batteries start to die down a bit. It takes about 3 minutes to sterilize a pacifier, but there's no real way to know how well it's working. Also, the directions tell you to rinse off the pacifier prior to use, so that might limit just how useful it is when you're on-the-go. Ultimately, I just wonder if using this is really any better than rinsing off the pacifier under very hot tap water.<br /><br />I wanted to like the Pipila Portable Pacifier Sterilizer, but at the end of the day, it just leaves me wondering if it's doing the job. I can see it having a place for people going out-of-town for a bit and wanting something available to help sterilize a pacifier if they're staying away from home, but the need for water (to rinse the pacifier) and the size (small, but not that small) limits its usefulness for those truly on-the-go, while there are better, cheaper ways to get the job done when you're at home.",2012-08-21

With our first child we used traditional pacifiers and we were constantly having to put it back in our child's mouth when it would fall out. But not the Wubba! This toy/pacifier is ingenious! It cuts down the need to replace it in the child's mouth drastically. If baby is sleeping with their head tilted to the side you can gently position Wubba so it is a prop up to hold the pacifier in baby's mouth. When baby is on their back looking up at the ceiling you place wubba on their chest and even if their little mouth relaxes and falls open during sleep, Wubba holds the pacifier gentaly in place so when baby seeks it -it is there! Before you know it little one will be holding on to it (great for helping to develop dexterity) and its too cute! We used to joke about how we wished there was a type of pacifier headgear... Well this is the closest thing to that without the odvious no-no's a headgear would bring ;-)",2012-08-04

The manufacturers might do well to either make the light brighter or make the thing hum or vibrate so it looks like it is doing something, but no - a normal light comes on and then it goes off and miraculously the pacifier that just fell on the floor is supposed to be sterile? I don't know.<br /><br />I do know that if it has snot on it or small pieces of dust or dirt, they don't fall off.

The hospital had the soothie type pacifiers, but my son never figured out that he was supposed to suck on it.  It seemed too stiff for his weak suck reflex. Compared to the MAM pacifiers we used with my older son, I like the design of these much better.  They seem to fit better in my son's mouth, especially being much smaller.<br /><br />We initially used them right before I would breastfeed him to get him practice sucking and then quickly transfer him to the breast.

If I could prevent another parent from saving their hard earned money then I'm going to try doing so. I'm a mom of a now 4 month old and saving money is my business. Yes I got this for free and it's a good thing I did because it would have been back in the mail to Amazon within a week which is all of what it lasted while I had it.<br /><br />Yes it's a great idea but unfortunately they didn't make a great product. Does it actually sterilize your baby's pacifier? I'm not entirely sure that it really does.<br /><br />It's pretty simple to use. You do need 2 AAA batteries that are not included. You put your baby's pacifier in the compartment, close the lid and the UV light comes on. It turns off after about 3 minutes and it claims that the pacifier is clean. I'd stick with inserting this in your Avent steam or electric sterilizer or boiling it in a pan of water. I must also say that its kind of bulky so if you have a very small baby bag this might not be what you want to take with you. Instead get some of those baby pacifier wipes. I have a [[ASIN:B001DKHPD6 Ju Ju Be Be All Diaper Bag, Lotus Lullaby]] and it took up quite a bit of space.<br /><br />I'm also really getting very skeptical about those 5 star vine reviews. Did any of them really use the product for more than one day? I'd go with the AMAZON VERIFIED PURCHASED reviews. None of them gave it 5 and barely any 4. Goes to show you exactly what kind of product this really is.",2012-05-23

My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth. I came across these and bought them because they were super cute but was unsure if my daughter would like them. Previously I had bought pacifiers that looked like the ones the hospital provided but were not. The plastic used to make them were shiny and for whatever reason my daughter had no interest in them. I later discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. These wubbanubs were in fact made of the same material and perfect for my little one. I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown. I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier. These pacifiers are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night. My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth. I have yet to lose these unlike the gazillion other pacifiers I have purchased over the years. They make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It is a somewhat meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib. So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills. There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The tabby kitten is my favorite.  I have noticed that it is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush, however, I usually cut the pacifier out after its seen some wear. Just as a caution. Once you stitch the the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket. I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.<br /><br />Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free.",2012-04-28

This thing is too cute, the nipple is too large for a new born but should be usable after about 6-9 months. There is no ring or ledge for removal from a baby's mouth or to attach a pacy clip to. This shouldn't be a big deal because this should probably only be used under CLOSE supervision due to the nipple size, weight and materials used.

The soothie and gumdrop pacifiers are the only ones recommended by lactation professionals for nursing babies, so I feel like if you have to use one of the soothies, why not have a cute one?  To wash the dragon, I've just used a damp cloth with some dish detergent and let him air dry.  It has worn just fine cleaning him with this method.  Just a reminder, the soothie is stitched to the dragon, so you cannot change out the pacifier, unless you feel comfortable sewing and are crafty.  I feel like for the money the dragon costs, I'd be too afraid to botch the job! Overall, I think it's an adorable novelty, but not incredibly useful.

I gave him one as he was getting ready to head down for his next nap.  It took a little work to get him to hang onto it, as he's been used to more traditionally shaped pacifiers (he's 11 weeks old), but he caught on fairly fast, and the next time he went to nurse I noticed that he was taking a deeper latch already!  I had some supply problems early on, so anything that encourages good latching and better milk transfer is okay by me.    I've noticed some reviews criticizing this pacifier for being a potential choking hazard.  Let me say that there is a degree of personal responsibility here.  These are not the hard plastic pacifiers most people are used to... they are medical grade silicone, made for newborns.  The whole thing is softer, more flexible, and yes, that means that you have to watch your baby to make sure he can't fit the whole thing into his mouth, because babies try that.  On the wrapper it says not to leave your baby alone with a pacifier (any pacifier), and I imagine that it's for precisely this reason.  If your child can fit the whole Soothie into his/her mouth, it's too small and you need to buy a binky that is appropriately sized for your child.    As for the suckerfish look... I think it's hilariously cute.    Update 2/19/12 - Still loving the Soothie, still refusing any and all other binkies.  Longer review on my blog:    [...]",2012-02-06

I live in Singapore and it took a while for the package to reach me and in the interim managed to find a more traditional style pacifier from Pidgeon but  with an olive shaped teat.  It's possible I would think more highly of the soothie if I had not tried the Pigeon pacifier first.  My baby  will take the soothie but does not prefer it over the pigeon one.  The problem with the Soothie is that it falls out of his mouth really easy.  If he lets up sucking for a moment it falls out of his mouth.  If it happens to roll out of his cot (which seems to happen more frequently than a regular pacifier) it always lands teat side down (regular pacifiers are more likely to land teat side up).  Additionally there is no cover for the soothie and it is more difficult to teather to a stroller or car seat so it is not a great pacifier to travel with.  In short:  I will use the soothies as back-ups as baby will take them but will not be buying more as a regular pacifier with an olive shaped teat is better",2012-02-02

I would suggest new moms give it a try though, because if you're going to introduce a pacifier, you might as well make sure it's natural!",2012-01-24

I had gotten her a clip for her binkie, but I wanted something better than that. I asked my friend in my breastfeeding support group where she got hers and she told me the website on the binkie. I came to amazon.com upon learning the name of them and I found a TON more than the duck and red puppy. I let my oldest daughter pick out my youngest daughters Wubbanub and she found this. I love how soft the elephant is. I was also very happy that for the first time in her two months of being on Earth she decided she didn't need the vanilla scent of her soothies from the hospital. We will now be ordering her the Red Dragon, as that was the one my husband wanted to get her.  I only gave it a 4 out of 5 stars because of the way it has to be cleaned, and the binkies are not interchangeable if the soothie gets worn down. At about 13-20 dollars a pop, I would think they would find a safe way to make the binkies interchangeable.",2012-01-22

Also, like many others have noted, it would have been nice if it could be sterilized.  I held the monkey over a pot of boiling water, being careful not to get the nose of the monkey too wet while the pacifier boiled.  Not sure how well it worked, but better than nothing!

It took some effort but I WAS able to do it (see the pictures I uploaded in the product images).<br /><br />The directions I got with the bear state that it can be tossed in the washing machine - pacifier and all - but I have not done that. It's a personal preference, just not sure how safe it is to get laundry detergent on a pacifier, even if it's rinsed. So I wash the pacifier by hand with hot water and replace it when necessary.<br /><br />When I first bought this my baby (then 8 months) did not like this bear because it was a bit heavy and it kept pulling the pacifier out of her mouth. Within a few days, though, she really got used to it. Before buying this, I was going nuts in the dark trying to locate the pacifier in her crib, and the fact that she has designs on her crib sheets didn't help matters because it was easier to lose among them! I purchased this bear to solve my problem, and it solved my baby's problem, too - when she starts crying at night she locates the bear (easy enough to do, even half asleep), puts the pacifier in her mouth and falls back asleep in no time. This bear is a lifesaver!<br /><br />EDIT: Dec/2013 - I recently had to replace this for my almost 2-year-old as she broke the loop. The original one I bought came in a drawstring bag with the green pacifier pictured as well as a clear plastic flat pacifier that looked like a teether. Now I spent more money (originally bought for around $11, this time bought for $15) and the pacifier pictured and the teether pacifier no longer comes with it. They really cheaped out and raised the price. I'm disappointed. Still a great product but not as pictured! I'd give this 4-stars now.",2012-01-19

Furthermore, it was too small and he had a hard time sucking/keeping it in. AUGH how frustrating.  Someone said;OH noooo he needs to have his sucking needs met. Well, he found his hands and consequently his thumb. Not sure if that is great either but I think it is the natural way.

One we passed that magic milestone of four weeks, we opened our new Wubbanub and a fast appreciation was had--babies love to suckle!  It calms them and allows them to gather themselves in the middle of a meltdown.  It is great to carry them through to the next feeding when they get older if you are trying to sleep train.

They are made of the same material (I believe it's the same brand too) as the Soothies the hospital gives out but they don't cover the whole face. The design makes it look like my baby is smiling and it's adorable. These let my baby breathe and enjoy her paci.",2012-01-03

She loves the MAM design! Almost seems effortless for her to suckle. The shape of the nipple seems to make the most sense.  As the baby learns to start rolling over and crawling, the pacifier design became so much more important to us. This on actually displaces the impact when she face plants while learning to crawl...You'll see. Great to have the removal strap option that clamps the pacifier to her clothes. These are overall, easy to clean and we found that at least in our baby's case, we know when to replace them...When the graphic starts to wear off, its time.",2012-01-03

I purchased it thinking I could attach my own pacifiers  to this stuffed animal, but instead it came with its own pacifier actually sewn to it.  (Thankfully it came with the same pacifier I use - [[ASIN:B0045I6IAO Philips 2 Pack AVENT Soothie Pacifier, Green, 0-3 Months]]) However, I like to boil pacifiers before initial use (can't do that here) and was hoping to be able to use the stuffed animal for different Nuk pacifiers as they wear down, etc.  Had I know that it wasn't a pacifier holder, but rather an all-in-one deal, I wouldn't have purchased this product.

EVER! -A must-have for moms!","I thought they were just adorable when I started buying Wubbanubs as gifts for friends. Now that I am a mom myself I can see how GENIUS these are!!!! Since binky's alwaysssss fall out, these animals sit on their chest and prop up the pacifier! So if he yawns it won't fall out. It is also easy to find and he likes to hold on to it and seems to cuddle with it. They are just darling and we LOVE THEM. We just buy more as they get worn out from our wear and tear. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and definitely worth every penny!!!!!!!!!",2012-01-02

My baby prefers the shape of the Nuk pacifiers over other brands:  the exterior is curved down below the nose and the orthodontic shape of the silicone pacifier.  Plus, the sports theme is very cute.  I did buy these at a local retail store so I could choose a package that include a baseball + football pacifer.",2012-01-02
