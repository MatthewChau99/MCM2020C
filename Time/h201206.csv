Knowing that over the years there had been many an upgrade to hand-held blow-dryers, I spent about half a day reading through all the reviews on Amazon and checking out Consumer Reports (the latter being not much help in this area, I have to say).  This little jewel seemed to fit my needs:  quiet, light, multiple temperature selections and speeds, and a cool setting, too.  Plus, it had that fancy-shmancy ion stuff that's supposed to make your hair shine (although my thought on that was, yeah, right).  I have to admit, too, that I am partial to Conair as I have found that they last for YEARS and provide a nice powerful flow of air that helps me style my usually short hair.  Well, this new Conair 173RZ Ion Shine Ceramic Turbo hair dryer is now my new love.  It blows through my hair like a strong wind and the temperatures range from hot to cool with a perfect warm in-between (my usual setting).  The slide temp/power selection system is not my preference, as my thumb sometimes slips and I end up with the wrong setting for a second, but I am getting used to it.  It gets my hair dry in less than a minute.  While the dryer is not what I would call a whisper, it is not as loud as my previous Conair and for that I am thankful.  A nice little extra is that it folds in half at the top of the handle - great if you have storage issues.  But, the most surprising thing of all is that my hair actually DOES shine when I'm done!  I have salt and pepper hair and the salt gleams like sparkling silver threads afterwards.  What a treat!

I was fed up having cheap blow dryers that never lasted. I loved the blow dryer, it lasted me till a month ago. Guess the $110 I paid for it back then was worth the 6 years I got out of it. I was looking at buying the same one or at least a Chi blow dryer again, I just didn't want to spend the same amount of money, I was hoping to stay under $60. I did a bunch of research and saw that this blow dryer, T3 Featherweight, was on the list of best blow dryers the last few years and saw the price was close to what I wanted to pay and $30 cheaper than the Chi I had before. I also saw that it said it was a fast drying blow dryer like my old Chi, which I prefer since I have a ton of hair. After using it for over a week. I think it works pretty good.. not much difference from my Chi I had. It's lighter than my chi and it's made of some kind of plastic like material. It also looks solid white and black in the picture, but it's actually got some kind of silver pattern going on over the white which I'm not thrilled with, but it's not the reason I bought the blow dryer so I'll get over it. Seems to take about the same amount of time to blow dry my hair as the chi, maybe a little faster. I usually take about 8-15 minutes to blow dry my hair depending on how detailed i get with it, like I said I have a ton of hair.

I was a bit hesitant to get a fold-able travel dryer since their reviews don't tend to be as good, however this one was the exception, which is why I went for it. The main features I was looking for in a new dryer was the weight, size, power and I would prefer it to be a ceramic dryer since they are healthier on your hair. My old dryer was the Vidal Sassoon VS501 1875W Ionic Sensor Touch Dryer. The VS501 lasted me several years and technically it still works.

I don't even KNOW a man who uses a hairdryer, so I don't know why this is for Men. That being said, this is the best hairdryer I have ever used. Don't ask me to explain what that Ionic setting does---the manufacturer doesn't even explain it to my satisfaction. But, somehow, it DOES WORK on my cobweb-fine, delicate, difficult, body-less, totally straight, almost-waist-length hair. I wear it long and braided so I can ignore it as much as possible, and so it doesn't fly around all the time and get tangled in stuff or end up in people's food.  I only wash it once a week because it's so darn dry---it would probably all fall out if I washed it every day. I don't perm, color, or otherwise mess with it because chemicals just destroy it. I've had the split ends of my braid knot up so badly in the wind that I've had to cut an inch or more off. Most hairdryers are really hard on my hair, so I use them as little as possible.<br /><br />I like the design of this hairdryer---it's fairly light, comfortable to hold, and the attachment nozzle is nice for focusing the air where I want it. There's nowhere my hair can fly into the works and get tangled. I use the ionic setting with the heat on high, and control the amount of hot air with the handy cool burst blue button that turns the heat off. My hair dries faster and untangles easier than it ever has in my life. Not only that, but it STAYS untangled all week. How is this possible? I don't know. I DON'T CARE!<br /><br />I thought maybe I was imagining all this, so I asked my daughter-in-law to try it. She said, That was the best experience I've ever had with any hairdryer in my whole life.<br /><br />Please don't comment that this can't possibly work and it's all unscientific and that I'm making stuff up, as someone has on one of my other reviews.

I don't know but I am really glad to have it.  Purchased at Folica when they had a $40 off special.<br /><br />I have thick medium length wavy fine hair.  Wash it 5-6 days a week at the gym.  Had been using their Hot Tools dryers-- two at a time, one in each hand--quite a spectacle -- and then using a flat iron.  I was happy with the end result but wanted to reduce the time spent.<br /><br />Researched the dryers to death and then just got fatigued and popped for the Sedu as it has tourmaline and ionic, and it has a regular plug-- I had some bad luck with those huge GF plugs on my hair iron.  The price is insane but since I use this nearly every day . . . .<br /><br />Compared to the Hot Tools dryer, this does not get hotter (which is a good thing because the Hot Tools is plenty hot enough to fry your hair), but it does blow more forcefully.  The dryer is small and easy to handle.  Did not find it at all heavy.  Was able to use the one dryer in one hand and brush in the other.  It still got my hair dryer faster than using the two Hot Tool dryers.  And much straighter and much smoother.  That was the surprise, and the reason I say I am a skeptic no longer.  Something about the dryer-- the tourmaline? the ions? really does make a difference.  Because my hair was already straighter by the time it was dry (since I could use the brush) the time spent using the flat iron was significantly reduced.<br />I hope that with in addition to reducing the time I have also reduced the trauma to my hair.<br /><br />I cannot tell if this is worth the big premium over the Solia and the SuperSolano which both look to be very nice dryers.

I hate to bad mouth any product from Remington because I am a fan of their other products, but I just don't see how this can just be a coincidence.

After this review I decided to contact the Remington online customer service and sent them a message with my complaint.  Shortly thereafter I received an email from them asking me to return the broken one and they would send a replacement.  They sent the shipping box and the label as well and within 10 days I had a new dryer that I have been using since with no problems.  Granted it has only been a month but I was very impressed with Remington.  I just hope that no one there was injured when testing the dryer (lol)... it really did blow flames.  Obviously there was a short which could happen with any electrical product but it was the way that the company responded that I had to give the rating of 4 stars when previously I only give it 1.  I really do like this dryer and how my hair looks and feels afterwards which is very different from other dryers that are no ionic.  Plus it dries my hair super fast without drying it out.<br /><br />PREVIOUS REVIEW:  Bought this dryer 4 months ago even though I read the bad reviews as well as the good ones and was concerned but figured it was a good brand name. i only use a hair dryer at most 2x/wk. Last night I was using the dryer on my wet hair and flames and sparks started shooting out of it!!! Thank God my hair was wet and didn't have any flammable product in it. I showed it to my boyfriend who suggested that I contact consumer affairs for Remington, which I just did. Since it has been over 30 days I can no longer return the appliance to Amazon. I have had many hair dryers and most of the time they have just worn out after a year or 2 but this was just scary.<br /><br />1/18/13 - Almost 1 year later... and still working perfectly.  In fact, I bought another dryer in the interim, waiting for the new Remington and paid a pretty penny for the new one.  I used both multiple times, trading off one for the other. I found that I prefer the Remington over the other more expensive name brand dryer. The Remington does not leave my hair fly away and seems to give it a nice sheen (is that possible?). It drys my hair better and more evenly.mington over the other more expensive name brand dryer. The Remington does not leave my hair fly away and seems to give it a nice sheen (is that possible?).

I don't remember the brand, but it was really expensive and high end. I think it was somewhere around $175 new. So, the other day the heat finally went out on it and I needed to replace it. This time, no question, anything other than an ionic simply won't do. Anyways, I found this one and just used it for the first time with a completely wet head and I am so impressed, I can't even believe it!! I'm not sure if the ion charges on my old dryer had gradually worn out, or if the technology now is just that much better? But I couldn't be happier. It took all of 10 minutes to completely dry and style my hair and it looks amazing, with VERY little frizz and enhanced the shine too. My other blow dryer had been taking me more like 15 minutes. This Remington does have greater watts / power too, but even on the lower setting, my hair was getting dry faster and styling perfectly. I should also mention the design is really neat looking too. It does not feel as heavy (quality) as my other one and the precision (extra) part felt like it was made kind of cheap. But, of course! My other one was about four times more expensive.

Here's what we found:<br /><br />My husband has very short hair and only uses a hairdryer on occasion.  He thought the Mangroomer felt good and solid in his hands-light weight and dries his hair no different than any other hair dryer.<br /><br />My son used the Mangroomer for a few days.  He has longer hair (about 3 inches long), just over the ears.  He traded off between a smaller, cheaper hairdryer to the Mangroomer and thought it was less noisy than the cheaper, older model he is used too.  He thought the dryer was sleek looking, more manly than the girl hairdryer he has been using.  The different speeds and temperature settings were a plus considering he's never had the choice.<br /><br />Lastly myself, I have shoulder length hair that has a course texture.  I use a hairdryer every day.  The Mangroomer looks and feels manly.  In comparison to my 1 year old Remington hairdryer, the main handle is wider and less fitted to the hand.  The buttons do not get in the way in comparison to other hairdryers that place them front and center.  The buttons on the Mangroomer are on the side, which never seem to get in the way.  The Ion button is located on the side of the barrel with a cool blue button indicator.  With or without the Ionic button I felt the dryer was the same.  A huge plus to this hairdryer is the speed in which it dries your hair.  It pushes a lot of air to dry quickly.  Another important thing to note is in comparison to my hairdryer the air does not get as hot, personally I think this is why the hair feels softer and more manageable than when I use the other hairdryer.  I actually noticed a difference in the softness of my hair.  It seems absurd to think a hairdryer can do this but as a person who dries her hair daily, I won't be going back to the other hairdryer, even if this one is built bigger for a man.",2012-02-25

At the time I made this purchase, reviews were pretty good and the warranty for each  hair dryer was for 4 years.  Within 6 months, both travel size dryers were no longer working.  They smelled of burning wires, and were VERY HOT!  The company REFUSED to replace them, saying they no longer made this particular model.  Before the end of the 1st year, one of the regular size dryers had gone bad as well(same hot, burning smell), and the other before 15 months was up.  Comapny wouldn't return a phone call or answer an email.  I tried many times for 3 months, finally giving up and calling the seller (QVC).  I really didn't expect them to do anything after 15 months, ( and they didn't), but I wanted to warn them about the company not standing behind the warranty that they used in their sales pitch.  They are still selling them, so this warning is for potential buyers from anywhere.  DON'T BUY T3 brand products!!!",2012-02-21

It feels soft to the touch rather than the slick plastic of the older models. But after just a couple of weeks of use, the coating started bubbling and peeling off in the area where I hold the hair dryer. I've only had it for a month and a half, and the outer coating looks positively pathetic already. I also don't like the settings on this model--there are only two speed settings, with the lower one being barely on.

I guess they felt this was an under-served market even though the total available market (tam) for men is probably much smaller than the women's market when considering that a) there are alot more bald men than women, b) alot of men barely comb there hair so they certainly don't blowdry it, and c) the wife's hairdryer is already sitting there if needed.  But, if you want a manly hairdryer then I guess this fits the bill.  It does have manly color - evokes feelings of a red Corvette.  It is substantial weight and feels good in the hands.  It appears to have extra horsepower to blow hair in a manly fashion and it has lots of speeds to fiddle with.

I actually bought this at Target because my other dryer had stopped working and I couldn't wait a few days for a new one to be shipped to me. I went with the intention on getting a different one but I got to hold them both in my hand and I really liked the way this one felt. The handle is sort of slanted back, which sounds awkward but it feels more balanced this way. It also doesn't have that annoying high pitched whining sound that accompanies most dryers. I also like that there is a cold shot switch that you don't have to hold in. It stays on cold shot until you switch it off. The sliding power switch isn't difficult to slide. The tension is just right in that you're not going to accidentally switch it off constantly during use, nor will you have a hard time getting it to move.

When I first started using T3's pro ionic/ceramic hair dryer last year,I noticed and felt an immediate difference on my hair. After using it for about two months, I'm very happy with the results. My hair became more manageable and is less frizzy. It is soft and smooth. I thought all the Touramaline ionic/ceramic hair dryers would produce similar results. So I was searching for a less expensive alternative one so that I can have two ionic dryers on hand. I read the positive reviews on this Andis hair dryer, then I decided to purchase it. I'm thankful the delivery was super fast! After using it a few times, I have to say the result is just mediocre. Compare to T3, this Andis model loses its shine! My hair feels dry after using it. It doesn't seem to be able to smooth out my hair or create shine and eliminate frizz as well as the T3 does. It works just like a regular hair dryer for me, except because of the ionic in it, it does dry hair faster than non-ionic hair dryers. Overall, here are the pros & cons in my opinion on this Andis 75370 Tourmaline ionic/ceramic hair dryer.<br /><br />PROS: It has a beautiful black and gold finish on the exterior; a good size for home use; powerful air flow; dries hair fast; 3 heat settings/2 air speeds; has the cool shot button;<br /><br />CONS: feels heavy on hand & noisy; heat settings/air speeds settings are in odd position, the switches seem to get in the way while holding and using the dryer; the blue ion indicator light is extremely bright, it's very annoying; the overall result in terms of adding silkiness and shine isn't impressive; not sure if the heating material is made with solid ceramic?<br /><br />The Bottom line: This hair dryer is not bad, it does the drying job alright. I just don't think it's great for those with thick/wavy & coarse hair type hoping to get smoother and luster result after blow dry.

I'm pretty confident that won't happen with either of these products and the other haircare products I use.

The Tan Towels were just getting to be very pricey.  I found that these ones work just as well as the others! However, it seems like it takes a few more applications with the Loreal brand to get the same color as Tan Towels, but for this price that hardly matters.  Some may even think this is a positive, because it allows you more control over your tan.  I used these every night for 3 days and I have a wonderful natural looking glow.  Not too dark at all and not overly noticable.  These are great for us fair skinned folks that only need a bit of color.  I'm not sure you can call this a deep dark tan, but that wasn't what I was looking for anyway. These take a bit of practice to use (since you can't see where it is going on), but after becoming an expert with the Tan Towels, these were easy. Always use a circular motion! Also, I found that putting a little bit of lotion on my writs after application really helps with the steaking on my wrists (this was a problem area for me). AND, I wash my hands immediately afterward and use the MUCH lighter Jergens natural glow lotion on my hands instead, this also helps with the streaking factor.",2012-01-09

I'm no scent expert, but to me Fiori d'Arancio smells like *delicate fruit loops* Ok that sounds totally wacky but its a sweet, clean fruity smell, and smells natural--you can tell there arent chemicals in the scent unlike gross body splashes and stuff. its really hard to find a way to smell these before purchasing too, (occasionally you can find sample vials on an auction or deal site) and they are expensive, so the mini is a great way to test it out in an affordable way before upgrading to a full size. If the fruit loop smell is not for you, pass it on to a teenage girl you love. Personally I love it! Sometimes I mix it with my lavanilla rollerball for a delicious fruity vanilla scent!

The best part is that it doesn't leave me a sweaty mess when I'm done.  I don't know if it's just the air speed, or the well-designed air flow and concentrator, but even though it can blast some HOT air (I actually have to back it down to medium heat when I have the concentrator on), I am not dripping in sweat when I'm done blowing it straight section-by-section with my round brush.  This makes me so happy!  I can wash and dry my hair and be ready for makeup in so much less time than I've ever been able.  It's no louder than average.  It's no heavier than average.  But it works so much better than average.  I love how you press the cool shot button and it stays cool, then push it again and it goes back to hot.  No more holding it down awkwardly.  I have accidentally pressed it a time or two, but so easy to press it back and move my hand down a smidge.

I haven't timed how long it takes to dry my past-shoulder length hair, but it is definitely under 5 minutes, and fast enough for me to do what I need to do.<br /><br />- leaves my hair in better condition - I always winced at using my old hairdryer because I knew I was damaging my hair in the process. I've had chronic dry hair issues and my old dryer left my hair flying every which way. I used to dry my hair only partially to lessen the damage. This dryer hasn't erased my dry hair issues completely but my hair is noticeably softer and I don't worry the way I used to about using it on my hair.<br /><br />- leaves my hair better looking - This was the biggest surprise of all. I have had such problems with my hair that I had simply resigned myself to the fact that my hair is hard-to-control. My hair is past shoulder length as mentioned, and layered. With my old dryer I absolutely needed to style my hair if I wanted to look presentable. I've spent so much money over the years trying out different brushes, rollers, etc. I could never simply wash, dry and go because with my old dryer my layers always ended up sticking out rather than curving in, and my hair would not hold any style without significant work. I was honestly shocked the first time I used the John Frieda dryer - my hair fell into a very flattering shape after 2-3 minutes of drying. I don't use a brush, don't use any of the attachments, nothing. I just dry about 90% of the way and my hair looks great. It's too bad that a month before I found this I'd already invested in a set of steam rollers. Now I won't be needing any of those tools.<br /><br />The noise level is normal for a hairdryer. I would not say it is quiet but it is not annoyingly loud. It is also quite manageable and easy to hold. I'm petite (small wrist) and I was afraid this would be a bit unwieldy, but it is lightweight enough to use without feeling at all flimpsy or cheap.<br /><br />The only fault I have found so far is the positioning of the buttons, right where my hand holds the dryer. For this reason I keep accidentally switching the air from hot to cold without wanting to. But it's a minor point given all the other advantages.eable and easy to hold.

My hairdresser convinced me to get a new dryer so I picked her brain for what features to look for. When my daughter said she wanted a new dryer I pulled out the list of features my hairdresser gave me and that made me think to share it here.   1) concentrator  That's the main thing my old one lacked and why it was worth buying a new one - just for that. I have shorter hair and use a curved brush to style in shape; the concentrator focuses the heat on the curve I'm styling and it does make a big difference. The dryer also comes with a diffuser but that's for completely different hair than I have.  2) power - my stylist gave me a number of Watts and I don't remember the number but this unit exceeds it. This is something to be careful of anyway. We had an electrician looking at a problem with blowing the bathroom circuit and he said it's common for new hairdryers to blow the circuits on old houses because new ones are so much more powerful. That turned out NOT to be our circuit problem but thought I'd mention that there are practical limits to high power that are a pain to cross. This dryer puts out all the heat my scalp can take.  3) cleanable vent- the back grille should be easy to open & clean out lint. Major impact on strength of the fan & on life span of the appliance if you keep the lint out.  4) 3 heat settings  5) 3 fan settings (this unit is actually a compromise with only two fan speeds + off but I always use high anyway 'cause  I'm impatient)  6) swivel cord vs. retractable cord - My hairdresser said she looks for a swivel cord but it was pretty well impossible to find in less expensive models even in beauty supply stores (realize pros pay over $100 for professional hairdryers) I looked high and low for this feature. It probably extended my search for a new hairdryer by almost a full year. I finally gave up on it when I set my sights on a retractable cord. The retractable feature also seems to keepthe cord tangle free. My curling iron has a swivel cord but it gets more tangled because it gets all scrunched up in the drawer. My biggest concern was that the retractable cord would give out but it's still going strong after 1 1/2 years. I love this feature as it keeps my dryer neatly tucked away in its drawer.   7) cold shot - My hairdresser didn't include this feature because she doesn't use it  but I wouldn't buy a dryer without it. This is a button that, when pushed in, makes the dryer switch to unheated air which sets a curl/curve much, much better. it takes a little more time to style the hair (which is why hairdressers often don't use it) but my style lasts days longer. Easy feature to find but it's not universal so if you want it you need to check for it and this dryer does have it. It's the blue button on the top of the handle.  Bottom line: I love this dryer. If it's been a while since you bought a new one, go for it. You'll be amazed at what a time saver it is. At this price from Amazon, it's a great value. In my area Target & Walmart sell this dryer for $5 more plus tax.  I'd buy it again in a heart beat.",2012-01-01
