The puppy is really bulky and heavy and we had a hard time keeping up with it. She loves to play with the ears of the giraffe as well.

I love how soft the elephant is. I was also very happy that for the first time in her two months of being on Earth she decided she didn't need the vanilla scent of her soothies from the hospital. We will now be ordering her the Red Dragon, as that was the one my husband wanted to get her.  I only gave it a 4 out of 5 stars because of the way it has to be cleaned, and the binkies are not interchangeable if the soothie gets worn down.

My baby though would gag whenever she got the nipple into her mouth.  Not really sure why... but she never had Soothies in the hospital or anything and prefers the Avent pacifiers with the wider, flatter nipple.  Also, like many others have noted, it would have been nice if it could be sterilized.  I held the monkey over a pot of boiling water, being careful not to get the nose of the monkey too wet while the pacifier boiled.  Not sure how well it worked, but better than nothing!  The monkey could've been a bit heavier too, as it often fell off of my baby. (She's 4 months, so this would work way better for a kid still being swaddled.)",2012-01-20

It took some effort but I WAS able to do it (see the pictures I uploaded in the product images).<br /><br />The directions I got with the bear state that it can be tossed in the washing machine - pacifier and all - but I have not done that. It's a personal preference, just not sure how safe it is to get laundry detergent on a pacifier, even if it's rinsed. So I wash the pacifier by hand with hot water and replace it when necessary.<br /><br />When I first bought this my baby (then 8 months) did not like this bear because it was a bit heavy and it kept pulling the pacifier out of her mouth. Within a few days, though, she really got used to it. Before buying this, I was going nuts in the dark trying to locate the pacifier in her crib, and the fact that she has designs on her crib sheets didn't help matters because it was easier to lose among them! I purchased this bear to solve my problem, and it solved my baby's problem, too - when she starts crying at night she locates the bear (easy enough to do, even half asleep), puts the pacifier in her mouth and falls back asleep in no time. This bear is a lifesaver!<br /><br />EDIT: Dec/2013 - I recently had to replace this for my almost 2-year-old as she broke the loop. The original one I bought came in a drawstring bag with the green pacifier pictured as well as a clear plastic flat pacifier that looked like a teether. Now I spent more money (originally bought for around $11, this time bought for $15) and the pacifier pictured and the teether pacifier no longer comes with it. They really cheaped out and raised the price. I'm disappointed. Still a great product but not as pictured! I'd give this 4-stars now.",2012-01-19

He would drop every single one and the one he liked he kept in for only a few minutes.  Bottom line, we realized HE DIDN'T WANT IT. That's why he'd drop it.  We took it away at six weeks and that was the best thing we ever did. We all slept, he was happy, helped with the breast feeding and made our lives much easier.  This pacifier kept falling all over the place, he'd cry some more.  Then I'd try to give it when he was on his side and still fell off. No matter where my son was this wubbanub didn't stay. Furthermore, it was too small and he had a hard time sucking/keeping it in. AUGH how frustrating.  Someone said;OH noooo he needs to have his sucking needs met. Well, he found his hands and consequently his thumb. Not sure if that is great either but I think it is the natural way. Yes, it maybe challenging to weaning of off the thumb, but we thought the paci would be hard and it wasn't it. Who knows!

Yes, I know the American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend introducing a pacifier until much later, but I requested it.

Especially the part where you're supposed to hold it. Of course the looks didn't matter much to our baby. She liked it.

(also, a pre-wash is recommended on the packaging).  but after following the manufacturer's washing instructions (cold wash, tumble dry low), the vinyl melted and gathered in one big spot on the back.  so now there are a bunch of holes, and the pad isn't going to stretch enough to even fit the mattress.  very disappointing.  what a waste of money!  also, as a side-note, when i tested the sizing on the pack 'n play mattress (before washing), it was too big.  i figured it'd be fine once i put a lot of effort into making sure to pull and smooth any extra material to the underside of the mattress.  and after i put a sheet over top to help hold everything in place.
