I do really wish, however, that the cold-shot button could be set so you don't have to continually hold it down.

I have been careful to sort of break in the first one by using low power for a minute before going to high power and then to switch to low power when I am finished before turning off.  I was concerned since several reviews stated that they had problems with the unit failing after using it only for a short time.  So far I am very pleased with my purchase and am considering buying two more to keep as reserves.  It is almost impossible to buy 1600 W dryers now and even harder to find dryers than have the side mounted motors and fans which I like.  The new 1875 W dryers can cause circuit breakers to trip and I don't feel we need that much heat on our hair. We must all remember that in this economy everyone is trying to cut costs, and that pertains to hairdryers as well as everything else.  Anything we can do to reduce the shock to a new appliance can possibly lengthen the life of the product.  Nothing lasts as long as they used to as we have found with clothes washers and dryers, refrigerators, dish washers, AC units etc.  However, so far, I am extremely pleased with this hairdryer.  Hopefully that will stay the same for months ahead.",2012-09-13

Not one of the three lasted more than 10 months. It is not worth the hassle to return these cheap hair dryers. The cost of shipping both ways is more than buying a new one.

When I received it, I opened the box and began putting it together.  One of the pieces did not fit so I just thought that maybe I was doing it wrong.

After one email and two phone messages, I received a phone call back only to tell me that the manager said that the piece does fit and to try harder.  WHAT??!!  I tried so hard that I gashed my finger!  The customer service agent was very nice but had to relay this message to me from the manager.

I found it at walmart for $35, which wasn't the most expensive one that they had, but I've used John Frieda products before so I figured it would be a good try. So far, I really like this dryer. It feels like it could be a lot more expensive.<br />I compared it to my mother's $80 or so hairdryer and it actually keeps up with it pretty well. I really like how the engine feels and sounds. It works pretty quiet and has a low hum rather than the high pitched noise a lot of cheap-o hairdryers have. It doesn't shoot the air quite as fast and it doesn't get QUITE as hot as the $80 blowdryer my mom has, but it's pretty great at it's job because my hair actually looks better when I use this hairdryer vs the more expensive one. It definitely fights frizz very well.<br />The only problem I'd say I have with it is that it's a heavier dryer than my old one that broke. I say problem because people may dislike that but I prefer it that way. When dryers have a bit of weight to them I feel like they've got a stronger motor. Not to mention I really don't notice when I'm using it.<br />As for the people complaining about the buttons, I can't say that I can relate. I guess I have very small hands so I can hold the dryer pretty well without messing with the buttons too badly, but so far EVERY blow dryer I've seen has the buttons on the side pannel like that, I think you just have to get used to it.<br />Overall, awesome dryer.

After reading the good reviews about it, I thought it would be a safe purchase. Wrong. First: The hardware to mount it to the wall is flimsy and hard to work with. Tiny little screws. Second: it is very underpowered. The best thing about it is the nightlight. Bright enough so you don't have to turn another bathroom light on in the middle of the night.

I've always wanted a simple solution to great hair and this is exactly it. I used to own a Conair from the drug store and this Sedu has changed my perspective on hair dryers. I've always thought that I can never re-produce the kind of blow out that I get from salons but this hair dryer has made it possible. The air is pretty strong and I don't find the hair dryer heat up more than my drug store one. It does take most of the frizz away and my hair stays in a nice curve for the whole day when I use a round brush.<br /><br />To be fair though, this hair dryer more expensive so you would expect the higher quality to match the price tag. Another thing I found is that it's actually kinda heavy for its size. My old one is bigger but actually weight about the same as this one, maybe even less. If you are looking for a feather weight, maybe this is not for you. Other than that, I have no complaints.<br /><br />Loving it so far!",2012-06-28

It's the tiniest dryer I've ever seen!!!  It almost fits in the palm of my hand.  Folded, it's 4-5 inches long (not counting the cord).  I've been using it for about a week now just to test it out before my trip abroad and it's surprisingly very strong.  No weird smells as someone else mentioned- maybe their particular product has an issue.  So far mine is working great.  My hair is shorter so I'm not worried about how long it will take, but this thing is pretty strong.  I'm done in minutes.  The other great thing is that it has &#34;dual voltage.&#34;  I had to read up on this because I haven't traveled in a while and I guess a whole lot of electronics and stuff like this is made dual voltage today- so check your product and educate yourself.  Just look at this hair dryer, for example, and it will say 125V / 250V on the handle.  This means it will work anywhere where the voltage falls in that range... most if not all of the world. BUT YOU WILL NEED AN ADAPTER when going abroad with this.  So here is the tricky part if this stuff is new for you, too... you DON'T need a converter (more expensive) for anything that's dual voltage,  just an adapter.  The adapter is just the little plug part that goes into the wall so you can plug it in.  The converter is usually bigger and box-like and more expensive.  It converts the voltage. You can find adapters for just a few bucks.  Some dual voltage products have a little switch you have to bother with and it's dangerous if you forget to change that switch... no switch and no worries with this hair dryer!!  Just Google dual voltage and you can read up on it, and the difference between converter and adapter.  All these things are helpful to know when traveling abroad.  I love this thing... best thing I bought for travel recently since finding a hand-held luggage scale!  I originally jumped the gun and gave this5 stars.  Read my updates below.  12/20/12 Update:  This survived a trip to rural abroad and worked great, so long as I used it on low.  When I turned it on high it was like a crazy loud rocket ship and I thought it would take off or start fire- it was frightening!!!!  Yes, I did use my adapter, and it's possible it behaved this way because of the junkie old remote house with questionable wiring I was living in. Later I lived in a second, very modern house in the country's modern capital and it wouldn't plug into the wall at all in any part of the house!!  Yes, it was the right plug shape and I have no idea what that was about, again, the randomness is possibly the result of the house and the country I was in.  Who knows.  But I couldn't use it at all the last couple of months of my travels and that wasn't good.  I will continue to use it here at home in the USA where it works perfect.  Maybe better for local travel and still a great size if you have limited luggage space.  But I am changing my rating from 5 to 3 because the darn thing nearly gave me a heart attack the few times I accidentally put it on high while trying to turn it off.  I am still highly recommending this product for travel, but taking it abroad may be questionable.  1/15/13 UPDATE:  I barely started using it back home a month and the dang thing started making crazy noises and I thought it would explode or catch fire.  It basically went dead.  I tossed it in the garbage.  I am now changing my 3 star rating to 1 star.  I was wrong.  Turns out this was a piece of unreliable junk and potentially dangerous unreliable junk after all... didn't even last me a year.  And I barely used it!!!  Not fit for my traveling adventures.",2012-06-28

It is extremely light, not very noisy, and the buttons are in the right place. The cord is a little short (about 62 inches) but for a tiny New York bathroom with an electrical outlet at a waist level it is actually perfect. However, I can see how it can be trouble if your electrical outlets are low.<br /><br />I can't tell if the ionic feature does what is supposed to do because I had not owned a hair dryer before this one for a long time so I can't compare. I have very thick just-below-the-shoulders hair and it takes me about 5 minutes to dry it. It still gets static in winter.<br /><br />I like the simple white and black color. To me it looks much better than the silver finish on higher-end driers because they still look like plastic and fake and this one is not pretending to be what it is not. The painted text to identify on/off and temperature settings wore off in two days but the settings are intuitive and so you don't really need the text once you saw what is where. I've had it for just under a year and it is working just fine. All in all great purchase.",2012-06-10

It's got some weight to it and it feels solidly built, not cheap at all.<br /><br />My only complaint with this unit is that the air doesn't come out very forcefully.  The older, smaller dryers that I previously owned blew much harder than this one.

Knowing that over the years there had been many an upgrade to hand-held blow-dryers, I spent about half a day reading through all the reviews on Amazon and checking out Consumer Reports (the latter being not much help in this area, I have to say).  This little jewel seemed to fit my needs:  quiet, light, multiple temperature selections and speeds, and a cool setting, too.  Plus, it had that fancy-shmancy ion stuff that's supposed to make your hair shine (although my thought on that was, yeah, right).  I have to admit, too, that I am partial to Conair as I have found that they last for YEARS and provide a nice powerful flow of air that helps me style my usually short hair.  Well, this new Conair 173RZ Ion Shine Ceramic Turbo hair dryer is now my new love.  It blows through my hair like a strong wind and the temperatures range from hot to cool with a perfect warm in-between (my usual setting).  The slide temp/power selection system is not my preference, as my thumb sometimes slips and I end up with the wrong setting for a second, but I am getting used to it.  It gets my hair dry in less than a minute.  While the dryer is not what I would call a whisper, it is not as loud as my previous Conair and for that I am thankful.  A nice little extra is that it folds in half at the top of the handle - great if you have storage issues.  But, the most surprising thing of all is that my hair actually DOES shine when I'm done!  I have salt and pepper hair and the salt gleams like sparkling silver threads afterwards.  What a treat!

I was looking at buying the same one or at least a Chi blow dryer again, I just didn't want to spend the same amount of money, I was hoping to stay under $60. I did a bunch of research and saw that this blow dryer, T3 Featherweight, was on the list of best blow dryers the last few years and saw the price was close to what I wanted to pay and $30 cheaper than the Chi I had before. I also saw that it said it was a fast drying blow dryer like my old Chi, which I prefer since I have a ton of hair. After using it for over a week. I think it works pretty good.. not much difference from my Chi I had. It's lighter than my chi and it's made of some kind of plastic like material. It also looks solid white and black in the picture, but it's actually got some kind of silver pattern going on over the white which I'm not thrilled with, but it's not the reason I bought the blow dryer so I'll get over it.

I don't even KNOW a man who uses a hairdryer, so I don't know why this is for Men. That being said, this is the best hairdryer I have ever used. Don't ask me to explain what that Ionic setting does---the manufacturer doesn't even explain it to my satisfaction. But, somehow, it DOES WORK on my cobweb-fine, delicate, difficult, body-less, totally straight, almost-waist-length hair. I wear it long and braided so I can ignore it as much as possible, and so it doesn't fly around all the time and get tangled in stuff or end up in people's food.  I only wash it once a week because it's so darn dry---it would probably all fall out if I washed it every day. I don't perm, color, or otherwise mess with it because chemicals just destroy it. I've had the split ends of my braid knot up so badly in the wind that I've had to cut an inch or more off. Most hairdryers are really hard on my hair, so I use them as little as possible.<br /><br />I like the design of this hairdryer---it's fairly light, comfortable to hold, and the attachment nozzle is nice for focusing the air where I want it. There's nowhere my hair can fly into the works and get tangled. I use the ionic setting with the heat on high, and control the amount of hot air with the handy cool burst blue button that turns the heat off. My hair dries faster and untangles easier than it ever has in my life. Not only that, but it STAYS untangled all week. How is this possible? I don't know. I DON'T CARE!<br /><br />I thought maybe I was imagining all this, so I asked my daughter-in-law to try it. She said, That was the best experience I've ever had with any hairdryer in my whole life.<br /><br />Please don't comment that this can't possibly work and it's all unscientific and that I'm making stuff up, as someone has on one of my other reviews.

I don't know but I am really glad to have it.  Purchased at Folica when they had a $40 off special.<br /><br />I have thick medium length wavy fine hair.  Wash it 5-6 days a week at the gym.  Had been using their Hot Tools dryers-- two at a time, one in each hand--quite a spectacle -- and then using a flat iron.  I was happy with the end result but wanted to reduce the time spent.<br /><br />Researched the dryers to death and then just got fatigued and popped for the Sedu as it has tourmaline and ionic, and it has a regular plug-- I had some bad luck with those huge GF plugs on my hair iron.  The price is insane but since I use this nearly every day . . . .<br /><br />Compared to the Hot Tools dryer, this does not get hotter (which is a good thing because the Hot Tools is plenty hot enough to fry your hair), but it does blow more forcefully.  The dryer is small and easy to handle.  Did not find it at all heavy.  Was able to use the one dryer in one hand and brush in the other.  It still got my hair dryer faster than using the two Hot Tool dryers.  And much straighter and much smoother.  That was the surprise, and the reason I say I am a skeptic no longer.  Something about the dryer-- the tourmaline? the ions? really does make a difference.  Because my hair was already straighter by the time it was dry (since I could use the brush) the time spent using the flat iron was significantly reduced.<br />I hope that with in addition to reducing the time I have also reduced the trauma to my hair.<br /><br />I cannot tell if this is worth the big premium over the Solia and the SuperSolano which both look to be very nice dryers.  But I am very happy with the Sedu.",2012-03-31

After this review I decided to contact the Remington online customer service and sent them a message with my complaint.  Shortly thereafter I received an email from them asking me to return the broken one and they would send a replacement.  They sent the shipping box and the label as well and within 10 days I had a new dryer that I have been using since with no problems.  Granted it has only been a month but I was very impressed with Remington.  I just hope that no one there was injured when testing the dryer (lol)... it really did blow flames.  Obviously there was a short which could happen with any electrical product but it was the way that the company responded that I had to give the rating of 4 stars when previously I only give it 1.  I really do like this dryer and how my hair looks and feels afterwards which is very different from other dryers that are no ionic.  Plus it dries my hair super fast without drying it out.<br /><br />PREVIOUS REVIEW:  Bought this dryer 4 months ago even though I read the bad reviews as well as the good ones and was concerned but figured it was a good brand name. i only use a hair dryer at most 2x/wk. Last night I was using the dryer on my wet hair and flames and sparks started shooting out of it!!! Thank God my hair was wet and didn't have any flammable product in it. I showed it to my boyfriend who suggested that I contact consumer affairs for Remington, which I just did. Since it has been over 30 days I can no longer return the appliance to Amazon. I have had many hair dryers and most of the time they have just worn out after a year or 2 but this was just scary.<br /><br />1/18/13 - Almost 1 year later... and still working perfectly.  In fact, I bought another dryer in the interim, waiting for the new Remington and paid a pretty penny for the new one.  I used both multiple times, trading off one for the other. I found that I prefer the Remington over the other more expensive name brand dryer. The Remington does not leave my hair fly away and seems to give it a nice sheen (is that possible?).

I don't remember the brand, but it was really expensive and high end. I think it was somewhere around $175 new. So, the other day the heat finally went out on it and I needed to replace it. This time, no question, anything other than an ionic simply won't do. Anyways, I found this one and just used it for the first time with a completely wet head and I am so impressed, I can't even believe it!! I'm not sure if the ion charges on my old dryer had gradually worn out, or if the technology now is just that much better? But I couldn't be happier. It took all of 10 minutes to completely dry and style my hair and it looks amazing, with VERY little frizz and enhanced the shine too. My other blow dryer had been taking me more like 15 minutes. This Remington does have greater watts / power too, but even on the lower setting, my hair was getting dry faster and styling perfectly. I should also mention the design is really neat looking too. It does not feel as heavy (quality) as my other one and the precision (extra) part felt like it was made kind of cheap. But, of course! My other one was about four times more expensive. As long as this one doesn't break anytime soon, I am sure I will be VERY happy with it!

Here's what we found:<br /><br />My husband has very short hair and only uses a hairdryer on occasion.  He thought the Mangroomer felt good and solid in his hands-light weight and dries his hair no different than any other hair dryer.<br /><br />My son used the Mangroomer for a few days.  He has longer hair (about 3 inches long), just over the ears.  He traded off between a smaller, cheaper hairdryer to the Mangroomer and thought it was less noisy than the cheaper, older model he is used too.  He thought the dryer was sleek looking, more manly than the girl hairdryer he has been using.  The different speeds and temperature settings were a plus considering he's never had the choice.<br /><br />Lastly myself, I have shoulder length hair that has a course texture.  I use a hairdryer every day.  The Mangroomer looks and feels manly.  In comparison to my 1 year old Remington hairdryer, the main handle is wider and less fitted to the hand.  The buttons do not get in the way in comparison to other hairdryers that place them front and center.  The buttons on the Mangroomer are on the side, which never seem to get in the way.  The Ion button is located on the side of the barrel with a cool blue button indicator.  With or without the Ionic button I felt the dryer was the same.  A huge plus to this hairdryer is the speed in which it dries your hair.  It pushes a lot of air to dry quickly.  Another important thing to note is in comparison to my hairdryer the air does not get as hot, personally I think this is why the hair feels softer and more manageable than when I use the other hairdryer.  I actually noticed a difference in the softness of my hair.  It seems absurd to think a hairdryer can do this but as a person who dries her hair daily, I won't be going back to the other hairdryer, even if this one is built bigger for a man.",2012-02-25

They smelled of burning wires, and were VERY HOT!  The company REFUSED to replace them, saying they no longer made this particular model.  Before the end of the 1st year, one of the regular size dryers had gone bad as well(same hot, burning smell), and the other before 15 months was up.

It feels soft to the touch rather than the slick plastic of the older models. But after just a couple of weeks of use, the coating started bubbling and peeling off in the area where I hold the hair dryer. I've only had it for a month and a half, and the outer coating looks positively pathetic already. I also don't like the settings on this model--there are only two speed settings, with the lower one being barely on.

As someone who regards his hair as stuff that sits on top of my head and needs to be kept in some semblance of tidiness, a grooming product is of little interest to me. I rarely use a hair dryer when I am away from home and it's very much a matter of if it's there I'll use it; if it isn't, then that's what a towel is for.<br /><br />The Mangroomer is a pleasant surprise. The bright red and black design is appealing -- clean, bold and well-shaped. It looks good and feels good. I liked the solid construction and the firmness of the controls. Most of the features go way beyond my needs. I still don't know what all the ionization stuff means; all I want to do is dry my hair quickly and have it feel good. The Mangroomer meets my basic needs in this regard.<br /><br />The slightly higher than average price doesn't seem to me to be excessive and the design makes it worth a few extra dollars.

As soon as I received it, I contacted Amazon's Customer Service via an online chat and told them they sent me the wrong item. I was sent a link for a UPS return label, which I printed out. I asked the rep if they could arrange for UPS to pick the package up since I live in a very rural area, and they were responsible for the fulfillment and shipping of the product. I was told that I would have to find a UPS drop-off point myself. (It was very frustrating dealing with the online chat rep.)  I tracked the return of the package to Amazon and waited for my refund. Six business days AFTER they received the hair dryer, I still didn't see a refund to my credit card.  This time I checked the box asking for one of Amazon's Customer Service reps to call me, which they did, immediately. This time, my experience with Customer Service rep #2 was excellent. The gentleman who helped me out was a true pro. He researched my transaction and issued a credit to my account, which hit the next day. I would never order anything from NewVo Beauty again.

I found that the hairdryer volume while running is pretty acceptable (not sure if I'm alone on this, but I hate really loud hair dryers). The design is attractive and I guess a little manlier than the standard hairdryer? I don't know, grasping for reasons why this is a mangroomer specifically, but yeah it looks pretty cool and not feminine.

I guess they felt this was an under-served market even though the total available market (tam) for men is probably much smaller than the women's market when considering that a) there are alot more bald men than women, b) alot of men barely comb there hair so they certainly don't blowdry it, and c) the wife's hairdryer is already sitting there if needed.  But, if you want a manly hairdryer then I guess this fits the bill.  It does have manly color - evokes feelings of a red Corvette.  It is substantial weight and feels good in the hands.  It appears to have extra horsepower to blow hair in a manly fashion and it has lots of speeds to fiddle with.  In my usage I actually found it to be a good hairdryer - it does the job blowing my short hair around any which way I chose.  But, since my wife has a hairdryer to be honest I don't quite have the bathroom real estate available to store two hairdryers.  Overall, I give it four stars.  A quality product but a bit high on the price/value when considering that there are other serviceable hairdryers that cost less.  Also in terms of necessity factor - for married guys not sure you want a second hairdryer in the bathroom.

I also like that there is a cold shot switch that you don't have to hold in. It stays on cold shot until you switch it off. The sliding power switch isn't difficult to slide.

When I first started using T3's pro ionic/ceramic hair dryer last year,I noticed and felt an immediate difference on my hair. After using it for about two months, I'm very happy with the results. My hair became more manageable and is less frizzy. It is soft and smooth. I thought all the Touramaline ionic/ceramic hair dryers would produce similar results. So I was searching for a less expensive alternative one so that I can have two ionic dryers on hand. I read the positive reviews on this Andis hair dryer, then I decided to purchase it. I'm thankful the delivery was super fast! After using it a few times, I have to say the result is just mediocre. Compare to T3, this Andis model loses its shine! My hair feels dry after using it. It doesn't seem to be able to smooth out my hair or create shine and eliminate frizz as well as the T3 does. It works just like a regular hair dryer for me, except because of the ionic in it, it does dry hair faster than non-ionic hair dryers. Overall, here are the pros & cons in my opinion on this Andis 75370 Tourmaline ionic/ceramic hair dryer.<br /><br />PROS: It has a beautiful black and gold finish on the exterior; a good size for home use; powerful air flow; dries hair fast; 3 heat settings/2 air speeds; has the cool shot button;<br /><br />CONS: feels heavy on hand & noisy; heat settings/air speeds settings are in odd position, the switches seem to get in the way while holding and using the dryer; the blue ion indicator light is extremely bright, it's very annoying; the overall result in terms of adding silkiness and shine isn't impressive; not sure if the heating material is made with solid ceramic?<br /><br />The Bottom line: This hair dryer is not bad, it does the drying job alright. I just don't think it's great for those with thick/wavy & coarse hair type hoping to get smoother and luster result after blow dry. If your hair type is normal & fine, frizz is not the major concern for you, you may be okay and satisfied with this one.w dry.

I have a cheap ConAir that I keep on hand for when my good dryers break so I can get by until a good one arrives. This is a good one, and what a difference! I'm so glad it arrived quickly or my hair would've been toast! I have thick, fine, fuzzy flyaway hair and with the pik attachment I have had no problems. The only problem was on my end. When the unit arrived, I thought the spongy tape material within the concentrators were for packing purposes so removed it. I had to get some more from a local craft store so DO NOT REMOVE THAT TAPE!! My bad.<br /><br />Again, I'm not a professional but I don't want charbroiled hair either. I'm pretty confident that won't happen with either of these products and the other haircare products I use. I'm fond of haircare products with argan oil in them for its thermal protection since my stylist tells me my ends aren't bad at all; that's after she reprimands me for not coming in but every 6 to 9 months.<br /><br />I ordered the [[ASIN:B002RC8IMQ Andis Elevate Nano-diamond Ceramic Digital Flat Iron]] to go with it and was not so happy, so see that review to understand why.<br /><br />I even used the Elevate on my dog today without issue. Of course it helps that I used to groom dogs so know better than to leave it in one spot for too long which can endanger a pet by burning him/her.<br /><br />Addendum 03/15/2012<br />I've noticed a few people complain about the design of the dryer with regard to the on/off switch and utilizing the pik attachment. It takes some getting used to in order to hold the dryer and feed your hair through the pik. I had a difficult time at first as well. I can't describe the way I do it (I'm not even sure I'm doing it correctly). I can only say that once I got used to it, it was easy to use the pik and NOT shut the dryer off.",2012-01-30

I timed it and dried my fine, wavy chin length hair straight in 4 minutes (I also used the Vidal Sassoon VS7963 Ionic Thermal All Purpose Brush).

This blowdryer is easy to use and a great value for the price!<br /><br />Update: 11/25/12<br />Almost a year later, the blowdryer still works very well. Nothing broke and I enjoyed it all year. Today I took off one star, however, because the dryer doesn't come with enough options: no styling nozzle or difuser. The settings are also very basic. So I did buy a new blowdryer (from a different brand) for not much more money than ths one, in order to have more options such as two styling nozzles and options for 3 temperatures at different  blowing speeds.

Some may even think this is a positive, because it allows you more control over your tan.  I used these every night for 3 days and I have a wonderful natural looking glow.  Not too dark at all and not overly noticable.  These are great for us fair skinned folks that only need a bit of color.  I'm not sure you can call this a deep dark tan, but that wasn't what I was looking for anyway. These take a bit of practice to use (since you can't see where it is going on), but after becoming an expert with the Tan Towels, these were easy. Always use a circular motion! Also, I found that putting a little bit of lotion on my writs after application really helps with the steaking on my wrists (this was a problem area for me).

If the fruit loop smell is not for you, pass it on to a teenage girl you love. Personally I love it! Sometimes I mix it with my lavanilla rollerball for a delicious fruity vanilla scent!

I used the longest settings for the top (maybe 1.5), shorter settings for the side, and the shortest settings around the ears and back for a tight taper.

Finally, on Christmas, it was mine!  I love this dryer so much.  It dries my hair SO much faster than any other dryer - even some pricier ones I've used in the past.  The best part is that it doesn't leave me a sweaty mess when I'm done.  I don't know if it's just the air speed, or the well-designed air flow and concentrator, but even though it can blast some HOT air (I actually have to back it down to medium heat when I have the concentrator on), I am not dripping in sweat when I'm done blowing it straight section-by-section with my round brush.  This makes me so happy!  I can wash and dry my hair and be ready for makeup in so much less time than I've ever been able.  It's no louder than average.  It's no heavier than average.  But it works so much better than average.  I love how you press the cool shot button and it stays cool, then push it again and it goes back to hot.  No more holding it down awkwardly.  I have accidentally pressed it a time or two, but so easy to press it back and move my hand down a smidge.   My hair is very fine and a bit wavy, and I have a LOT of it, so I really need a dryer that can get in there and start drying out the hair, especially in the back and at the crown, before I start sleeking it down with the concentrator, and this dryer can do it in minutes without me sitting around air-drying it for 20-30 minutes first.

I haven't timed how long it takes to dry my past-shoulder length hair, but it is definitely under 5 minutes, and fast enough for me to do what I need to do.<br /><br />- leaves my hair in better condition - I always winced at using my old hairdryer because I knew I was damaging my hair in the process. I've had chronic dry hair issues and my old dryer left my hair flying every which way. I used to dry my hair only partially to lessen the damage. This dryer hasn't erased my dry hair issues completely but my hair is noticeably softer and I don't worry the way I used to about using it on my hair.<br /><br />- leaves my hair better looking - This was the biggest surprise of all. I have had such problems with my hair that I had simply resigned myself to the fact that my hair is hard-to-control. My hair is past shoulder length as mentioned, and layered. With my old dryer I absolutely needed to style my hair if I wanted to look presentable. I've spent so much money over the years trying out different brushes, rollers, etc. I could never simply wash, dry and go because with my old dryer my layers always ended up sticking out rather than curving in, and my hair would not hold any style without significant work. I was honestly shocked the first time I used the John Frieda dryer - my hair fell into a very flattering shape after 2-3 minutes of drying. I don't use a brush, don't use any of the attachments, nothing. I just dry about 90% of the way and my hair looks great. It's too bad that a month before I found this I'd already invested in a set of steam rollers. Now I won't be needing any of those tools.<br /><br />The noise level is normal for a hairdryer. I would not say it is quiet but it is not annoyingly loud. It is also quite manageable and easy to hold. I'm petite (small wrist) and I was afraid this would be a bit unwieldy, but it is lightweight enough to use without feeling at all flimpsy or cheap.<br /><br />The only fault I have found so far is the positioning of the buttons, right where my hand holds the dryer. For this reason I keep accidentally switching the air from hot to cold without wanting to. But it's a minor point given all the other advantages.eable and easy to hold.

My hairdresser convinced me to get a new dryer so I picked her brain for what features to look for. When my daughter said she wanted a new dryer I pulled out the list of features my hairdresser gave me and that made me think to share it here.   1) concentrator  That's the main thing my old one lacked and why it was worth buying a new one - just for that. I have shorter hair and use a curved brush to style in shape; the concentrator focuses the heat on the curve I'm styling and it does make a big difference. The dryer also comes with a diffuser but that's for completely different hair than I have.  2) power - my stylist gave me a number of Watts and I don't remember the number but this unit exceeds it. This is something to be careful of anyway. We had an electrician looking at a problem with blowing the bathroom circuit and he said it's common for new hairdryers to blow the circuits on old houses because new ones are so much more powerful. That turned out NOT to be our circuit problem but thought I'd mention that there are practical limits to high power that are a pain to cross. This dryer puts out all the heat my scalp can take.  3) cleanable vent- the back grille should be easy to open & clean out lint. Major impact on strength of the fan & on life span of the appliance if you keep the lint out.  4) 3 heat settings  5) 3 fan settings (this unit is actually a compromise with only two fan speeds + off but I always use high anyway 'cause  I'm impatient)  6) swivel cord vs. retractable cord - My hairdresser said she looks for a swivel cord but it was pretty well impossible to find in less expensive models even in beauty supply stores (realize pros pay over $100 for professional hairdryers) I looked high and low for this feature. It probably extended my search for a new hairdryer by almost a full year. I finally gave up on it when I set my sights on a retractable cord. The retractable feature also seems to keepthe cord tangle free. My curling iron has a swivel cord but it gets more tangled because it gets all scrunched up in the drawer. My biggest concern was that the retractable cord would give out but it's still going strong after 1 1/2 years. I love this feature as it keeps my dryer neatly tucked away in its drawer.   7) cold shot - My hairdresser didn't include this feature because she doesn't use it  but I wouldn't buy a dryer without it. This is a button that, when pushed in, makes the dryer switch to unheated air which sets a curl/curve much, much better. it takes a little more time to style the hair (which is why hairdressers often don't use it) but my style lasts days longer. Easy feature to find but it's not universal so if you want it you need to check for it and this dryer does have it. It's the blue button on the top of the handle.  Bottom line: I love this dryer. If it's been a while since you bought a new one, go for it. You'll be amazed at what a time saver it is. At this price from Amazon, it's a great value. In my area Target & Walmart sell this dryer for $5 more plus tax.  I'd buy it again in a heart beat.",2012-01-01

She said it cuts hair drying time down in half and her hair has so much volume after using it. I see where others say it doesn't last very long. Her old one was this same brand and lasted over a year. And our opinion is that even if you have to replace it after a year, its worth the cost and time to do so! :)",2012-01-01

Worked perfectly, so when we moved into our new house in 2011, we bought another one.  Again, works perfectly, very convenient, very well built.   Two criticisms -- the night light is TOO BRIGHT.  A dimmer on the side would be much preferred.  AND, the wall anchors that come with it really suck.  You'll need to buy a set of anchors to mount it correctly.    That said, we're buying another for our second bathroom.  It's a great unit.",2012-01-01
